1. Current BJP regime is a Brahmanical reaction to Congress led Socialism.
2. EWS reservation wants to perpetuate both caste based privileges and discrimination against 'lower caste'.
	- People who have given the world the oldest and greatest form of institutional inequality when hearing about justice and equality retort to social shaming, derogatories remarks against them are common.
3. Sons of Socialism -> why people who have enjoyed the benefits of socialism esp the Industrial class of Indians, should try to promote such values in their lives and should avoid moving towards material exploitation of human resources. Accumulation of wealth should not be the sole reason for human existence. 
4. There is no merit only privileges. Why the present system of reservation and affirmative action have made little impact on the lives of lower sections of Indian people. Upwards economic mobility of these sections have virtually stopped. 
5. The real test of a persons character comes not in success but in failures.
6. Blaming colonial govt for bringing India to economic shambles and famishing its people : try to hide the fact that Indian society did not allow for the all inclusive development of its people. Caste basis of division of society, varnashram division of wealth and work, fragmented polity etc was the reason why Muslims were able to rule India for 800 years in the first place. British tried to keep intact the privileges that the landed upper sections of society already enjoyed ex. Zamindari System in Bengal and Bihar. It was only at places where this already existing social division was challenged where at present economic development could be seen ex southern India where a new class of Mirasidars emerged after the Ryotwari system - Existing basis of society was somewhat successfully challenged
