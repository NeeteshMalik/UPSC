          "description": "Tinkering with reservation quota in run-up to elections appears political ",
          "content": "<body class=\"art\" morss_own_score=\"2.354725495111557\" morss_score=\"23.711279314556002\"><h1>\nSuspect moves: On changes to reservation policy in Karnataka\n</h1><h3>Tinkering with reservation quota in run-up to elections appears political </h3><p> March 29, 2023 12:20 am | Updated 12:50 pm IST </p><p>Statecraft involves management of competing demands for accommodation and inclusion, without unduly affecting the interests of any section of society. However, some rulers, such as those in Karnataka, want to be seen as discriminating against a minority group in the hope of garnering the support of the majority. The <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-govt-scraps-muslims-quota-of-4-increases-quota-of-lingayats-and-vokkaligas-by-2-each/article66658455.ece\">Karnataka government’s decision to scrap the 4% quota for Muslims</a> within the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category and earmark an additional 2% each to the dominant Vokkaliga and Veerashaiva-Lingayat communities is a divisive gamble in the expectation of electoral dividends. The BJP regime has also created four sub-categories to introduce internal reservation for different Dalit communities under the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. The scrapping of reservation for Muslims, whose poorer members will now have to compete with the general category for the 10% ‘Economically Weaker Sections’ quota, is reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fadnavis-says-no-to-notification-on-muslim-quota/article7997954.ece\">abrogation of the 5% quota for Muslims in Maharashtra</a> in 2015. While reservation on the basis of religion alone is untenable, it appears that there has been no recommendation from the Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission for the withdrawal of reservation benefits for Muslims. The BJP has sought to portray the introduction of reservation for Muslims in 1995 as an instance of minority appeasement.</p><p>It is indeed true that the Constitution does not allow reservation on the basis of religion alone, and that there have been judicial verdicts striking down quotas for Muslims for not being backed by a proper study on the extent of backwardness in the community. However, it is possible to extend reservation benefits to the backward sections among religious minorities identified on the basis of relevant criteria. Some States have been implementing reservation in educational institutions as well as public employment for Muslims by including them in the Backward Classes (BC) list. It is futile to argue that large sections of Muslims have reached a level of social and educational advancement that will justify their exclusion from the BC category, or that they are not under-represented in the services. While Muslim leaders and organisations have opposed the scrapping of the reservation, the categorisation of the SC communities is also controversial. Sections of Dalits are up in arms against the reordering of the 17% SC quota among different groups. Major decisions, such as changing the reservation policy, in the run-up to elections are not merely suspect, but may end up stoking unwanted fires.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

          "content": "<body class=\"art\" morss_own_score=\"2.394945490584737\" morss_score=\"23.91991427959847\"><h1>\nTactical retreat: On Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s judicial overhaul Bills   \n</h1><h3>Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cannot deliver on his agenda without alienating large sections </h3><p> March 29, 2023 12:10 am | Updated 11:40 am IST </p><p>When Benjamin Netanyahu began his current term as Israel Prime Minister in December last year, he identified four main goals for the country’s 37th government: block Iran; restore Israel’s security and governance; deal with the cost of living problem; and expand the “circle of peace” (with Arabs). But in the past four months, his government’s single-minded focus was on passing its judicial overhaul Bills in the Knesset, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-why-are-israelis-protesting-the-governments-proposed-judicial-reforms/article66660366.ece\">triggering unprecedented protests</a>. Initially, Mr. Netanyahu, whose coalition has a comfortable majority (by Israeli standards) in Parliament, vowed to press ahead. As protests grew, rebellion broke out. He fired his Defence Minister Yoav Gallant after he called for a delay in passing the Bills, citing national security risks, but the crisis had already grown out of his hands. On Monday, amid protests and a paralysing general strike, the Prime Minister announced the suspension of the Bills, not wanting to push Israel into a civil war. Earlier, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/itamar-ben-gvir-the-rabble-rouser/article66158219.ece\">Itamar Ben-Gvir</a>, National Security Minister, had warned the Prime Minister against “surrendering to the anarchists” and threatened to quit the coalition if he did so. But Mr. Netanyahu has managed to keep his coalition together, for now. To ensure the support of Mr. Ben-Gvir, a Jewish extremist, the Cabinet would transfer the National Guard to his Ministry.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu, who first came to power in 1996 defeating Shimon Peres, has seen many ups and downs. Yet, the current crisis is arguably his toughest. Mr. Netanyahu has overseen a dramatic shift in Israel’s polity towards the extreme right. Its result: the current government, comprising the right-wing (Likud), religious (Shas and United Torah Judaism) and far-right (Religious Zionist and Otzma Yehudit) parties. The extreme right has long argued that the judicial checks and balances are preventing the country from realising its true Jewish identity; the planned judicial reforms, which would give Parliament control over judicial appointments and the powers to override Supreme Court rulings, are a part of this push. Mr. Netanyahu and his allies have been able to control the narrative when it came to the occupation of Palestine or countering external threats, but their move to consolidate more power has triggered widespread resistance from different sections, including from the defence establishment. By suspending the Bills, Mr. Netanyahu has only delayed, and not resolved, the impact of the crisis. He has promised to return the Bills to the Knesset after a month through consensus. But it remains unclear how there will be nationwide consensus on such a polarising issue that has seen even diplomats on strike. He should rather convince his allies of the crisis their government is in, abandon the plan to weaken the judiciary altogether, and focus on the more pressing challenges Israel faces.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

          "content": "<body class=\"art\" morss_own_score=\"2.3815987933634997\" morss_score=\"23.673785793043294\"><h1>\nDwindling allies: On the loss of Honduras ties leading to Taiwan’s isolation on the world stage\n</h1><h3>Taiwan is facing pressure as China’s relations with the United States deteriorate</h3><p> March 28, 2023 12:20 am | Updated 12:21 pm IST </p><p>By <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/honduras-breaks-diplomatic-ties-with-taiwan/article66663549.ece\">formally establishing diplomatic relations with China</a> on March 26, 2023, Honduras has joined a growing list of countries that have recently switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing. Taiwan now has only 12 countries, besides the Vatican, with which it has diplomatic ties, including four small Pacific island nations, Eswatini in southern Africa, Paraguay, and six central American and Caribbean nations. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/end-to-taiwan-ties-nears-as-honduras-foreign-minister-visits-china/article66652242.ece\">who signed the communiqué with his Honduran counterpart Eduardo Reina</a>, said it showed Honduras made “a choice to stand on the right side of history...”. Taiwan has accused Honduras of seeking financial assistance as a precondition to continue relations, and President Tsai Ing-wen said, after the switch, that Taiwan “will not engage in a meaningless contest of dollar diplomacy with China”. She also accused China of “persistently [using] any and all means to suppress Taiwan’s international participation, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-keeps-up-pressure-on-taiwan-with-4th-day-of-drills/article65741073.ece\">intensify its military intimidations</a>... and disrupt regional peace”.</p><p>The switch by Honduras, as well as Taiwan’s concerns about its shrinking international space, point to the growing stress on the current status quo across the Taiwan Strait. The status quo has generally served both sides across the strait well, preserving peace against tall odds. In Taiwan, a thriving democracy with a highly developed economy, the status quo remains the popular choice for most people, according to numerous public opinion surveys. A minority support Taiwan declaring independence or unification with China. However, both Beijing and Taipei have been accusing the other of changing this status quo. In Taipei’s view, Beijing has exerted growing diplomatic pressure to isolate Taiwan as well as stepped up military muscle-flexing, as seen in exercises that surrounded the island last year following the visit of then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In Beijing’s view, the ruling DPP in Taipei, with the support of Washington, bears responsibility for the tensions by pursuing de facto independence. Beijing had warmer relations with the previous KMT regime, with a landmark meeting between leaders Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou in 2015. The Xi government has warned the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-why-is-taiwan-caught-between-us-and-china/article65736938.ece\">U.S. that Taiwan remains a red line for China</a>, but with <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-secretary-of-state-anthony-blinken-defends-taiwan-after-honduras-snaps-ties/article66631335.ece\">worsening relations between the two countries</a>, Taiwan has yet again emerged as a friction point, as seen by the Pelosi visit last year. Beijing continues to refuse to rule out the use of force for what it calls reunification, should Washington or Taipei cross what it sees as a red line. The tussle between the world’s two biggest powers has left the 23 million people of a vibrant and prosperous island caught in the middle.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

          "content": "<body class=\"art\" morss_own_score=\"2.426481715006305\" morss_score=\"23.916468795109665\"><h1>\nGolden fist: On the victory for Indian women boxers\n</h1><h3>Indian women boxers, with their gold haul, should inspire others </h3><p> March 28, 2023 12:10 am | Updated 12:25 pm IST </p><p>Indian women boxers collected four gold medals — like their predecessors in 2006, M.C. Mary Kom, Sarita Devi, K.C. Lekha and R.L. Jenny — in the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nikhat-and-lovlina-add-more-golden-sheen-to-indias-campaign/article66665411.ece\">Delhi World championships</a> to make an emphatic statement ahead of the Hangzhou Asian Games, a qualifying event for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Seventeen years ago, when India recorded its best ever showing of four golds, one silver and three bronzes, the event was still young and women’s boxing was six years away from making its Olympics debut. The current performance of four golds, when the sport is in the Olympics and the event receiving 300-plus entries from 65 countries (this despite the boycott by some prominent nations as Russian and Belarusian athletes were participating under their flags amid the Ukraine war) is remarkable as it has propelled the third-time host to top the table. <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nitu-saweety-punch-their-way-to-world-titles-in-contrasting-style/article66662412.ece\">Golden girls Nitu Ghanghas</a> (48kg), Nikhat Zareen (50kg), Lovlina Borgohain (75kg) and Saweety Boora (81kg) had different accomplishments but needed to prove themselves again. Nitu, a Commonwealth Games gold medallist, was keen on making a mark at the elite level. Nikhat, the 52kg World champion, who came down to an Olympic weight and was unseeded, had to face six tough opponents and assert herself in the new class to become the second Indian after Mary to win more than one World title. Olympic medallist Lovlina, also a two-time World bronze medallist, was determined to establish herself in a new Olympic weight. Thirty-year-old Saweety, a 2014 World silver medal, wanted to underscore that she was no less. Some exciting talents that included 19-year-old Preeti Sai Pawar (54kg) and Jaismine Lamboria (60kg), impressed everyone. With multiple boxers vying for each spot, the coaches face a ‘good problem’ in the build-up to the Olympics.</p><p>The event, demonstrating the competitiveness and appeal of women’s boxing, should encourage the International Boxing Association (IBA), which is in conflict with the International Olympic Committee due to its exclusion from the Olympics over various issues. The IBA, monitored on site by an independent McLaren team, tried to ensure transparency and fairness. It took action against below-par match officials and athletes who seemingly enjoyed an unfair advantage. It offered a lucrative prize purse, including $100,000 to each winner, and financial support to boxers as an incentive to boost participation. The successful conduct of the event, barring the odd blip, has encouraged the IBA to look at India, a potential market, as a boxing destination. Eyeing a better performance in the Olympics, the Boxing Federation of India’s desire to stage more elite events will inspire the boxing community further.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

All the technical arguments notwithstanding, his disqualification is seen by most Opposition parties as a political move of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Regional parties continuously adjust their relationship with the two national parties, the BJP and the Congress. From the vantage points of many regional outfits, these two parties are not necessarily two polar opposites. As a general rule, regional parties seek to expand their influence and power through fluctuating relations with the national parties, even when they are technically equidistant from both. The party in power in Delhi has considerable leverage, and regional parties are often vulnerable to pressure. In recent years, central agencies (the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation) have cornered Opposition leaders, and gone either aggressive or passive on cases according to the convenience of the BJP. While these facts were apparent, regional leaders have remained wary of confronting the BJP, and have often broken ranks with the rest. The Trinamool Congress (TMC), for instance, was not in alignment with the Congress-led strategy against the BJP on the Adani controversy.</p><p>The expulsion of Mr. Gandhi has prompted the TMC, the Aam Aadmi Party, the Bharat Rashtra Samithi and the Samajwadi Party, which are usually wary of the Congress, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aap-trinamool-brs-sp-the-naysayers-come-out-in-support-of-rahul-gandhi/article66657261.ece\">to condemn the action and call it out as dictatorial</a>. These parties possibly realise that mutual rivalries and fear of the BJP and the central agencies could drive them to the margins or, even worse, at the receiving end of more vindictiveness. Fourteen of these parties have now approached the Supreme Court against the misuse of central agencies. The petitioners say they represent 42% of the electorate, and that 95% of the cases filed by the agencies have been against Opposition leaders. This is a move for self-preservation, and these parties are still far from having a joint view on several critical national issues. At the heart of the confrontation between the BJP and the Congress are questions regarding the Adani Group of companies that stands accused of dubious ownership patterns and business transactions. The BJP and the Centre have so far deflected these questions. While Opposition parties such as the  Biju Janata Dal in Odisha and the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh continue to stay aloof, it is noteworthy that other Opposition leaders have come out against the expulsion of Mr. Gandhi. Nevertheless, a robust opposition to the BJP is still a work in progress.

Taking credit for some of the heavy lifting, India’s Ministry of External Affairs has said that India was the first Sri Lankan bilateral creditor to support the debt restructuring and to provide assurances to the IMF in January. Since last year, New Delhi has been a key part of Sri Lanka’s support structure, appealing on its behalf to the IMF and World Bank, extending a $4 billion package including credit lines, loans and debt deferrals, and raising the issue of debt sustainability at the multilateral sphere including the G-20. China, Sri Lanka’s biggest bilateral creditor, and Japan (part of the Paris Club of international financiers) did not move as quickly, which held up the IMF announcement. Announcing the first tranche of $330 million on Tuesday, Mr. Wickremesinghe said that the key message was to assure other lenders about Sri Lanka’s capacity to service its debt, and potentially enable it to access about $7 billion from international institutions and the IMF. Some credit is due to Mr. Wickremesinghe and his cabinet who have stabilised a few indicators since coming to power in challenging times last year.</p><p>However, the IMF decision is no magic pill. This is Sri Lanka’s 17th IMF bailout, and the third in the past decade. The IMF loan also comes with a number of conditions, which will cause more hardships and make the government, that has about 10% approval ratings, more unpopular. Adding to its discomfiture is the IMF distancing itself from the government’s decision to postpone local elections, saying it had made no political stipulations. In its report, the IMF calls the risks to implementing the programme as “exceptionally high”, refers to Sri Lanka’s track record of implementing reforms as “weak”, and calls for contingency plans in case there is a deeper crisis induced by weak market indicators. Apart from grappling with soaring inflation, stimulating growth and inviting global investment, the government must also ensure that creditors are satisfied with its debt restructuring process and no one accuses it of “side-deals”. Sri Lanka appears committed to turning the corner, and is mending fences with every international player engaged in its complex geopolitics, including the U.S., Japan, India and China. It is important that in turn, they recognise Colombo’s precarious position and cooperate in shoring up the island nation as it continues to navigate a difficult economic path.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Democracy flourishes when there is reconciliation through legislative debate. Yet, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/two-congress-legislators-and-few-wardens-hospitalised-following-bedlam-in-kerala-assembly/article66622098.ece\">adversarial relations resulting in confrontation</a> following the lack of discourse over differences on issues of public import, speak poorly of legislative conduct. This holds true of Kerala, where legislative business has come to a standstill after a severe deterioration in relations between the ruling coalition and the Opposition. What began as an issue of the Speaker repeatedly disallowing discussion on Rule 50 notices by the Opposition United Democratic Front last week has grown into <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/opposition-disrupts-kerala-assembly-demanding-action-against-those-responsible-for-wednesdays-assault/article66625741.ece\">a full-blown confrontation</a>, with legal cases being filed against legislators after incidents that resulted in a ruckus in the Assembly. A case can be made that it ill behoves the Opposition to resort to parodying Assembly proceedings after the Speaker’s denials or to protest in an unparliamentary way against the Chair, currently held by A.N. Shamseer. But the onus is on the Speaker and the ruling front to ensure that the Opposition’s legislative privilege to have discussions on pressing issues is respected and allowed. Clearly, the repeated denial of <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/assembly-chaos-opposition-and-ruling-front-clash-over-life-mission-corruption-case/article66562900.ece\">discussions on Rule 50 notices</a> and the filing of serious legal cases against Opposition members have only deepened the confrontation. Other grievances expressed by the Opposition that their legislators do not get sufficient play on Sabha TV, the official broadcaster, also seem to have merit.</p><p>On Monday, the Speaker struck a conciliatory note by expunging remarks made by him against a Congress legislator. He also assured the Opposition that he would uphold their rights that included the privilege to move Rule 50 notices on matters of “vital public importance” and ensure that the Assembly broadcaster was non-partisan. This should be the cue for both sides to begin a dialogue leading to the reversal of vituperative legal actions and the resumption of normal legislative discourse. Kerala is India’s bellwether on socio-economic issues, but it faces unique challenges as an ecologically fragile State that has to work on a balance between development and ecological sustainability, as the Brahmapuram fire incident also exemplified. Healthy discussion and debate over ideas, even if adversarial, would go a long way in ensuring good governance by keeping the LDF government on its toes. How the ruling coalition and, by extension, the Chief Minister, responds to the Opposition’s call for non-partisan conduct of legislative proceedings will determine the course of normalisation of relations between the two fronts in the State.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The United Nations has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Budget speech in February, singled them out as ‘Shree Anna’ — roughly translated as the ‘best among grains’ — adding that the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/government-to-support-hyderabad-based-millet-institute-as-centre-of-excellence-fm-sitharaman/article66457471.ece\">Indian Institute of Millets Research in Hyderabad would be supported as a centre of excellence</a>.</p><p>Millets such as sorghum, bajra and ragi are strongly linked to Indian dietary traditions, which is why the country has for long been the largest producer of millets in the world. It is no surprise that this cereal family is popular because it is energy dense, can be grown with ease in arid soils and, relative to grains such as rice, wheat and maize, is less susceptible to pests. Why such a ‘super food’ got sidelined by the Green Revolution of the 1960s in favour of rice and wheat has little to do with nutrition and more with the development of high yielding varieties of rice and wheat, that produced twice or thrice per acre. Coupled with guaranteed procurement by the government, the rice-wheat combination enabled India to be food secure even in droughts and climate blights. However, this food security came at a cost such as the wanton exploitation of groundwater, a surfeit of pesticide-use, and ossified systems of grain production and procurement that, over the years, is decreasingly remunerative for the average farmer. With average global incomes having risen since the 1960s and rising demand for ‘sustainable agriculture’, India is looking to market millet as a global panacea. However, competing with the global rice-wheat-maize troika, which according to the Food and Agriculture Organization constitutes 89% of global cereal production, means that millet production must be many times more remunerative than now. Hybrid varieties of jowar and bajra exist, and that yields have not dramatically risen in decades despite this means that it would be unrealistic to expect quantum jumps in yield from technological tweaks alone. Dietary shifts are slow processes and promoting certain grains as ‘superior’ or inferior is self-defeating as it ignores the economics of production and promotes cycles of hype — as seen in cash crops. This can have consequences for marginal farmers. Letting all grains grow and helping a wider base of consumers access the cereal they want is a more sustainable enterprise.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Last week’s retail inflation reading for February from India’s NSO, at 6.44%, clearly belies the RBI’s most recent forecast for Q4 inflation of 5.7%. With January having logged CPI-based price gains of 6.52%, prices will have to soften so sharply in March as to drag the headline number down by more than 230 basis points to about 4.1% for the RBI’s projection to come true. A look at the components driving inflation shows that core inflation, which strips out the impact of food and fuel prices, still remains stuck at 6.2% for a third straight month, and continues to hover almost at or above the 6% level since May 2021. That core inflation remains persistently elevated despite the RBI having raised its benchmark interest rate by 250 basis points since last May reveals the difficulty monetary authorities are facing in tamping down on price gains by increasing credit costs so as to dampen demand. Governor Shaktikanta Das and the RBI’s two other members on the Monetary Policy Committee all cited the worrying persistence of core inflation at their last policy meeting in February as justification for deciding to continue tightening monetary policy.</p><p>Queering the pitch further is price gains across the food basket too showing disconcerting trends despite a marginal deceleration of five basis points last month in the composite food price index. Prices of four key categories in the food basket that together account for more than a fifth of the Consumer Price Index continued to register significantly high year-on-year inflation, as well as sequential hardening. If the key staple of cereals and products saw inflation accelerate to 16.7% in February, the headline reading for milk and products quickened to 9.65%, that for fruits surged to 6.38% (from January’s 2.93%), with only the reading for spices slowing a tad to 20.2% (from 21.1%). With the prediction of a likely El Niño this year, the outlook for food prices is hardly reassuring. While policymakers will, therefore, need to stay focused on containing inflation, the rising uncertainty about the growth momentum sustaining in the face of the heightened risks of a recession in advanced economies raises the risk that higher credit costs may further dampen consumption. Yet, failure to engender enduring price stability could lead to stagflation. Unless supply side measures such as GST rationalisation and fuel price cuts are expedited, the overall macroeconomic outlook appears worrying.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

This was not the first fire at Brahmapuram. Studies by the CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, in 2019 and 2020, concluded that the many fires released highly toxic substances into their surroundings; they are also likely to have been released in this fire. These facts indicate two problems — solid waste accumulated at the site, and it was not removed quickly enough. And, also, two kinds of failure. First, Kochi’s solid-waste management apparatus is too tenuous for the amount of waste it produces and the Brahmapuram waste-to-energy plant is dysfunctional. The former is a pan-India problem, due to overconsumption, low resource-use efficiency, and not handling such waste properly. Solid waste can be biodegradable, when it is composted, or nonbiodegradable, when it is repurposed, combusted, or landfilled. Such waste does not go anywhere else; so, if any of these three channels are clogged, waste will collect in the others. This is why landfills are signs of urban dysfunction. The second kind has to do with waste not being removed efficiently from stockpiles — by feeding it into waste-to-energy plants and by recovering commercially important metals, refuse-derived fuel, and bio-soil — and by storing the flammable waste in a way that would not prevent fires.\r</p><p>The Brahmapuram plant appears to have been in the State’s blind spot. Such facilities work only when the relatively more expensive power they produce will be purchased; the amount of combustible waste they receive is proportional to the amount of purchasable power they can produce; and the waste they receive has sufficient caloric content to produce that power. The plant is dysfunctional: the State must explain why and revive it. Also needed are answers about the landfilling and biomining contracts, why contractors failed their obligations, and why course-correction was not effected sooner. It is of concern that the State overlooked Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal orders to prevent such fires. Corruption in the face of the climate crisis beggars cynicism. Finally, Kerala needs to discard centralised waste-processing in favour of the decentralised mode encouraged by its Solid Waste Management Policy. The State is unlikely to meet its goal of being waste-free by 2026 if it does not achieve its circular economies, which it will not unless its trash mountains dwindle instead of becoming climate pollutants in their own right.\r</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rahul-gandhi-owes-an-apology-to-all-indians-bjp/article66627147.ece\">wants Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to apologise</a> for <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i-had-pegasus-on-my-phone-indian-democracy-under-attack-rahul-gandhi-at-cambridge-lecture/article66574983.ece\">remarks that he made in London</a> recently about democratic backsliding in India; the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-leaders-form-human-chain-in-parliament-premises-demand-jpc-probe-into-adani-issue/article66626619.ece\">Congress is insisting on the constitution of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)</a> to probe <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/adani-issue-opposition-leaders-write-to-ed-says-it-cannot-abdicate-its-jurisdiction/article66622135.ece\">allegations of dubious financial transactions</a> and dishonest business practices against the Adani Group of companies. Available evidence suggests that Mr. Gandhi had categorically stated that the challenges to Indian democracy had to be sorted out domestically, and ruled out any role for foreign forces. With the Indian diaspora expanding, the ripple effects of politics in India are inevitable beyond the country’s geographical boundaries. In fact, the BJP has for long believed in cultural nationalism which is not contained within the geography of India. Mr. Modi has discussed national politics before audiences around the world. A democracy that does not allow criticism, including of democracy itself, is a contradiction in terms. Mr. Gandhi has not been able to speak in Parliament and explain his remarks; meanwhile, a BJP Member has initiated a process to terminate Mr. Gandhi’s Lok Sabha membership. It is an ill-advised move, and if carried out, will further amplify the fears of a democratic deficit in India.</p><p>In their clamour for an apology by Mr. Gandhi, BJP Ministers are also evading questions regarding government patronage of the Adani Group. The Congress has been seeking answers from the government on the links between the public sector Life Insurance Corporation of India and the State Bank of India with the Adani Group. The BJP and the government have been silent on this serious issue of governance that spans the government and the public and private sectors. Arbitrariness in decision making, followed by a lack of accountability, amounts to governance failure, if not collusion. The government, the Rajya Sabha chairman and the Lok Sabha Speaker should work with the Opposition for a discussion on the issues arising out of the Adani controversy. Coming clean is essential in maintaining the government’s credibility, the regulatory environment and the private sector. There have been precedents of a JPC in cases of financial scandals. The BJP has the numbers to get away with any disregard for parliamentary norms, but it should rise above that temptation and evolve as a true party of governance. Parliament has a role to play in fixing accountability, and the BJP should not avoid it and betray a new level of executive impunity.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

          "content": "<body class=\"art\" morss_own_score=\"2.402252816020025\" morss_score=\"23.81589157326068\"><h1>\nEndless delay: On the conduct of Governors and legislative agenda  \n</h1><h3>Constitutional functions should not be held hostage to personal differences</h3><p> March 18, 2023 12:10 am | Updated 11:31 am IST </p><p>The frequency with which the conduct or inaction of Governors comes up for judicial scrutiny reflects poorly on the state of relations between incumbents in Raj Bhavans and the respective Chief Ministers. The <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-moves-supreme-court-accusing-governor-of-delaying-assent-to-bills/article66618109.ece\">Supreme Court will soon hear an extraordinary petition</a> from the Telangana government, seeking a direction to the Governor, Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan, to grant assent to Bills passed by the State Assembly. Recently, the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-governor-had-already-summoned-assembly-session-on-march-3-sg-tushar-mehta-tells-supreme-court/article66563352.ece\">apex court disposed of a petition from the Punjab Government</a> that was aggrieved by an alleged delay in the Governor summoning the Assembly. The matter was resolved when it was submitted on behalf of the Governor that the Assembly would meet on the day desired by the State government. In earlier decades, a petition seeking a direction to Governors or questioning their inaction on constitutional matters would have been thrown out at the threshold itself. However, such is the extent to which the gubernatorial office is being overtly politicised by those holding it that courts may now be constrained to examine whether such inaction is justified. One sees a disturbing tendency in recent years of some Governors making use of the absence of a time-frame in the Constitution to indefinitely delay decisions. This tactic effectively stalls the elected regime’s legislative agenda.</p><p>The conflict between Raj Bhavan and the Chief Minister’s office witnessed in several States is quite acute in Telangana. Dr. Soundararajan has alleged that she is being boycotted by Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao and that her queries are not being answered. The State government, for its part, is apparently upset that she may be trying to act independent of the Cabinet. A recent tweet from her account the day after the State government went to court — conveying a message that Raj Bhavan was closer than Delhi — indicates that her stand is linked to her view that the government is unfriendly and discourteous. These considerations ought not to matter on constitutional issues. The Governor can either grant assent to a Bill or decline it, or reserve it for the President’s consideration. In suitable cases, it may also be returned for reconsideration. However, none of this should be based on the Governor’s personal view on the Bill’s content. One can understand an occasional query if any Bill seemingly violates fundamental rights, but a relevant question that requires an authoritative pronouncement from the court is whether the Governor should decide on its legality or the legislature’s competence each time a Bill is presented for assent. As the Supreme Court remarked recently, dialogue between constitutional functionaries should not become a race to the bottom. Constitutional functions should not be held hostage to political and personal differences.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

But the Supreme Court decision provided some relief to the EPFO which reduced the number of members/ pensioners who could gain from higher pension options.</p>\n<p>An official said the government is still in the process of figuring out the actuarial deficit post the Supreme Court decision. “It will be higher than what is stated in the latest annual report of the EPFO, but will definitely not be as high as Rs 15 lakh crore projected after the Kerala High Court judgement,” the official said.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/old-pension-scheme-employees-unions-firm-on-indefinite-strike-from-today-8495145/\">Old pension scheme: Employees’ unions firm on indefinite strike from today</a></div>\n<p>The total number of pensioners under EPS has more than doubled to 72.73 lakh in 2021-22 compared with 35.10 lakh in 2009-10. “In the coming years, given India’s demographic dividend, the inflows to the pension fund of the EPS are expected to be high given the addition to its membership. But when this progressively tapers off, the number of pensioners will be disproportionate to the number of existing members or new entrants. This is when the problem will kick in,” said another official in the government.</p>\n<p>According to Report of the Technical Group on Population Projections for India and States 2011-2036, 73.5 crore people or 60.7 per cent of India’s population was in the working age group — 15-59 years —in 2011 and this population group is expected to increase to 98.85 crore in 2036. While the working age population is likely to then taper off, due to increasing longevity, India’s population in the age group of 60 years and above is projected to increase from 10.15 crore in 2011 to 22.74 crore in 2036.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In the Supreme Court, the EPFO is learnt to have cited an actual calculation of 21,000 pensioners, detailing the difference between their contributions and upfront payment of pension arrears to be over Rs 250 crore.

The government is keen to ensure this does not jeopardise social security for low wage earners.</p>\n<p>In a series of letters to the EPFO earlier this month, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) had also raised doubts on the disclaimers put out on the portal. In its letter, it mentioned how the subscribers opting for the higher pension benefit have to undertake a declaration empowering the Central government to amend the scheme “as it may deem fit”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“As such, the pension calculation formula has already been specified/defined in the Scheme…then why is such a disclaimer inserted?” the letter said. Some pensioners have also filed review petitions in various state high courts.</p>\n<p>The EPFO has extended the deadline to opt for higher pension to May 3 from the March deadline earlier. The Supreme Court in a ruling on November 4 had upheld the amendments to the Employees’ Pension (Amendment) Scheme, 2014, implying another chance for employees who were existing EPS members as on September 1, 2014 to contribute up to 8.33 per cent of their ‘actual’ salaries — as against 8.33 per cent of the pensionable salary capped at Rs 15,000 a month — towards pension.</p><div>Also Read</div><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The EPS provides employees with pension after the age of 58, if they have rendered at least 10 years of service and retired at age 58. The monthly pension is computed based on this formula: Monthly pension = pensionable salary x pensionable service / 70, on a pro-rata basis linked to maximum monthly pensionable salary of Rs 6,500 for pensionable service up to September 1, 2014 and Rs 15,000 thereafter.</p>\n</div> ",

Apatanis principally use three rice varieties: Emeo, Pyape and Mypia.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/vale-of-apatanis-56032\">Vale of Apatanis</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The total area of the Apatani Plateau is 10,135 square kilometres, where rice-fish culture is undertaken approximately in 592.0 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice lands out of 715.7 ha.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau is a land of diverse cultures. The major festivals of Apatanis are the Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung. People here believe that these traditional festivals ensure better productivity and well-being.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from humid subtropical to temperate. So, this plateau receives adequate rainfall during the summer season. The permeability and water-retaining capacity of the clayey, loamy soil favour this unique farming technique.</p>\n<p>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a low-input and eco-friendly practice. The stocked fish practically depend on the natural food sources of the rice fields and thus, farmers hardly need to use any supplementary fish feeds.</p>\n<p>The farmers sometimes use household and agricultural wastes and excreta of domestic animals like pigs, cows, mithun (<em>Bos frontalis</em>) and goats to make farming more sustainable and organic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, azolla and lemna are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers. The organic food grown in the field plays an essential role in feeding fish.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/recognise-empower-indigenous-land-tenure-and-title-to-achieve-sdgs-holistically-un-report-75997\">Recognise, empower indigenous land tenure and title to achieve SDGs holistically: UN Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The water sources in these high-altitude rice fields are mountain streams and rainwater trickled down during the monsoon season.</p>\n<p>Bamboo pipes are being used to distribute water from the networks of earthen irrigation channels using two outlet pipes. An outlet is fitted angularly at the upper level through a dyke to maintain the water level and another outlet is fitted at the bottom of the dyke to the exterior. It is used for dewatering the field during harvest.</p>\n<p>Men and women perform different farm duties while preparing the fields for cultivating rice. And during the culture of fish, women folk participate as the major workforce.</p>\n<p>Ancient and old-fashioned agricultural technologies are utilised for cultivation. Modern tools like tractors and power tillers are not affordable as well as inaccessible to the farmers.</p>\n<p>They mostly use agricultural tools such as <em>Dao</em> (sickle) and dibbling sticks. After preparing the field, they transplant a maximum of two-three healthy rice plants with an average distance of 26 cm from each other.</p>\n<p><span>Fish refuges are also created inside the fields. Three strains of fish species of common carp — </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiospecularis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpio communis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpionudus — </span></em><span>are stocked just after ten days from transplanting rice.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492\">Sustainable rice production key to food security</a></span></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The stocked fish are harvested twice in a season. The first and second or final harvest is done in the middle of July and October, respectively. But the rice is harvested at the end of September until the mid of October, i.e. once in a season.</span></p>\n<p><span>Four cultivars of rice are grown along with fish species of </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiol</span></em><span>. The total productivity ranges from 300-500 kilograms of fish per hectare in one season (ha-1 season-1) and 3,000-4,000 kg of rice (ha-1 season-1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish enhances rice productivity (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the mineralisation of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances rice yield here. The records of rice and fish yields were obtained from the farmers through personal interviews.</span></p>\n<p>Dykes at a higher elevation and lower elevation are constructed with a height of 0.9 m to 1.5 m and 0.4 to 0.6 m. These dykes are also used to remove water from the field during harvesting. Bamboo fencing is done to avoid the escape of fish through the pipes.</p>\n<p>This eco-friendly and economically beneficial practice has made the system unique in terms of aquatic resource utilisation.</p>\n<p>The zooplankton and algal life forms serve as natural food sources for the fish in the flooded rice fields to enhance aquatic productivity. This ecosystem service, in turn, indirectly maintains healthy human-made swamps with better livelihood options for tribal framers.</p>\n<p>Field water depth is the limiting factor. All the agro-inputs in this ecosystem with organic manures, decomposed rice stubbles and macrophytes, along with other biotic and abiotic factors, regulate their various population properties in the inundated rice fields.</p>\n<p>For growth and development, the stocked fish in the rice field may have utilised and assimilated available aquatic biomass and zooplankton through trophic interactions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, high-altitude flooded environments enriched with such natural fish feeds have sufficient scope to raise fish as a concurrent crop of rice in the same field.</p>\n<p>In the context of plankton and other fish food organisms, the wet rice fields are still data deficient. The water quality parameters, community structure and population dynamics of algal life forms under the rice canopy are favourable for the growth and abundance of zooplankton, which greatly influences the fish yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such unique integrated farming systems require special attention for better productivity and profitability to the small-scale rural farmers in Assam and other northeastern hill states.</p>\n<h3>Read more:</h3>\n<p><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of</em> Down To Earth</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

A farmer can be termed as the first person to be impacted by climate change since s/he is in a livelihood that directly depends on climate.</p>\n<p>This affects the country’s overall agricultural output and also adds to food inflation. High food prices could result in people slashing down consumption as well. This, on the other hand, impacts negatively on nutritional security.</p>\n<p>Among farming households, a significant number produce food for their own consumption. These households gave birth to the old saying that those who eat their own food are also the healthiest ones.</p>\n<p>For countries like India where malnutrition is high and food insecurity is a nagging constant, such households have used the home production system to remain out of it.</p>\n<p>As many studies point out, these households are also protected from market fluctuations thus ensuring their affordability for healthy food. Obviously, they are not impacted by food inflation as well.</p>\n<p>But serious conversations are taking place over how climate change-induced extreme weather events would impact such households. To begin with, we need to know the linkage between nutrition intake and household food production; and whether weather fluctuation would have any impact on this.</p>\n<p>A recent research paper from the <a href=\"https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136557/filename/136768.pdf\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) attempts to answer the first question: How much do weather conditions impact a home food production system?</p>\n<p>Researchers Hiroyuki Takeshima, Sunil Saroj and Anjani Kumar have analysed village-level data from households on their own food production and consumption and correlated the local weather situations to infer whether there was a significant relationship.</p>\n<p>The IFPRI paper first established that people growing their own food consume more, thus adding to nutrition level and also attaining overall food security. “On average, growing grain crops at home led to Rs 12.184 higher average grain consumption per month per household,” found the research paper.</p>\n<p>This trend is not limited only to grains. Consumption increases significantly for pulses, dairy, vegetables and fruits, if grown at home. The research could establish a link between increased consumption and reduction in child stunting, underweight and women achieving normal body-mass-index. These trends are more pronounced in remote villages.</p>\n<p>But these ‘positive effects’ of growing your own food are observed to be ‘significantly magnified’ if the weather is closer to normal. This is the most definitive linkage of climate and food intake established by this research paper among the food-growing households.</p>\n<p>If the rainfall is one standard deviation closer to the normal figure, grain consumption increases by Rs 12.282. Similarly, if the temperature is one standard deviation from normal, consumption increases by Rs 5.723. This also means that normal weather will increase all other physical benefits.</p>\n<p>This implies that if these households experience adverse weather conditions, their overall food and nutritional security would be negatively impacted. Also, without normal weather, they may have to depend more on markets thus spending more on food than before. This would have an impact on overall economic well being.</p>\n<p>This makes the case for climate-proofing these food producers who till now remain untouched from the crisis. Moreover, these are the people who are yet to be impacted by the market-driven agriculture system. While climate change takes all under its grips, this system of food production needs a prudent reaction.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

          "content": "<section name=\"articleBody\" class=\"meteredContent css-1r7ky0e\" morss_own_score=\"9.960861056751467\" morss_score=\"24.865958392817042\"><p><em>I grew up in Idaho in a tight-knit family following the firebrand tenets of fundamentalist Christianity. So when I came out to my parents as gay in college, it ended with tears, screams and a laying on of hands. In my mid-20s, I came out again — this time in a letter sent from afar. I was determined to establish healthy boundaries with my parents, which led to years of silence between us. I tried to break that silence on more than one occasion, only to be blunted by their homophobia. Hopeful that context would change their thinking, I attempted to introduce them to my boyfriend one Christmas. My mother hung up on me. Again, years of silence followed.</em></p><p><em>More recently, my parents made a substantial effort to connect with me and the man who, in 2018, became my husband. They even made a trip to our city and made a show of acceptance, telling my partner over dinner, “We love you.” We were elated. Then, during the pandemic, my mother sent my husband — who works in health care — some disturbing Covid-19 disinformation. What began as civil correspondence escalated and ended with my mother telling my husband he would never be her son-in-law.</em></p><p><em>My parents made it clear that, in their eyes, our marriage was illegitimate. And yet they become angry when we decline invitations to family gatherings. I won’t sacrifice my husband’s well-being by forcing him to attend family functions. And I won’t cast aside the self-respect I’ve gained over years of therapy to meet my parents in their righteous space where I’m simply not welcome. I’ve made it clear that when they are ready to accept us for who we are — a loving married couple just like them — we will re-enter the family unit.</em></p><p><em>As my parents age, though, my hope that they will ever accept us dwindles. All my efforts at authentically connecting with them end with their unwillingness to consider the bigotry baked into both their worldview and their interpretation of Christianity, which, to them, is one and the same. Do I have any obligations to make further attempts to bridge this yawning gap? </em>— Name Withheld</p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"22.5\"><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>I’m so sorry to hear about what you’ve had to endure. Whatever duties we have to our parents, they don’t require us to do all the work of reconciliation. It’s perfectly reasonable to say that you won’t be joining them on family occasions unless they respect your relationship.</p><p>The hovering question, though, is whether this requires your parents to regard your marriage as religiously valid. Because marriage, for many Christians, is a sacrament — a ceremony with a specifically religious meaning — accepting gay marriage is different from treating people who are in civil same-sex marriages respectfully. You can do the latter even if you think that sex between men or between women is sinful. According to the Catholic Church and many Protestant ones, all sex outside heterosexual marriage is sinful (including masturbation), and yet lots of their members are perfectly capable of treating people who sin in this way respectfully; they know that most adults are, in this way, sinners.</p><p>That, if I understand your letter, was roughly where things stood with your parents before the recent falling-out. They had come a long way since the dark period when they sought to “pray away the gay”; they expressed respect for your relationship and love for you both. But you don’t report that they ever recognized your marriage as legitimate in God’s eyes and therefore in their own. They remained tethered to their religious convictions, even though they pulled that tether rather taut in order not to lose you.</p><p>Then an acrimonious exchange concerning your mother’s mistaken claims about Covid most likely left her feeling insulted and condescended to by your husband, and she insisted on the point that she could not accept your marriage. It’s unfortunate that she lashed out in this way; but, so far as I can see, what she said wasn’t really new.</p><p>So you have to decide whether it’s enough that your parents agree to treat you respectfully and lovingly, even if they’re unable to recognize the religious validity of your marriage. (The civil validity of your marriage is not, of course, in doubt.) The alternative is to require that they repudiate their core beliefs, a view of the world that’s regularly reinforced by their community. If you did want them to acknowledge your relationship fully, refusing to see them probably isn’t going to make it happen.</p></div><p>Many Christian believers come to see gay sexuality differently when they get to know gay people; this was why coming out was a good strategy for gay liberation. But the devout may then need arguments to reconcile their evolving views about gay relationships with their religious commitments. That’s the value of a book like “God and the Gay Christian: The Biblical Case in Support of Same-Sex Relationships,” by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/us/some-evangelicals-take-new-look-at-bibles-stance-on-gays.html\" title=\"\">Matthew Vines</a>; precisely because it adheres to what fundamentalists call “a high view of Scripture,” it might help your parents recognize that their current view is not the only possible Christian position.</p><p>For all that, your parents may never regard your relationship as on par with their own. I understand how difficult this is for you, given your upbringing; your sense of self-respect is, you suggest, hard-earned and perhaps fragile. And yet there’s something to be said for the implicit bargain that you previously reached — settling for love and esteem and not insisting that your parents “come into the light.” I’m not convinced that the authentic connection you talk about requires that your parents fully accept marriage equality, any more than it requires you to accept your parents’ views about purity and holiness. Often maintaining a certain distance from our kinfolk can help keep us together. The theologian Henri J.M. Nouwen memorably compared the interplay of closeness and distance in relationships to dancing: Sometimes we hold each other tightly, and sometimes we move away “and let the space between us become an area where we can freely move.”</p><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>Last week’s question was from a mother whose son had been incarcerated several times and currently was in prison. They had a fraught relationship, and now he was asking for financial support and care packages. She wrote: “A small special-needs trust fund for my son established by my late father has a balance of about $20,000 after previous withdrawals for similar requests. As trustee, I have the ability to grant his requests, but I’m not inclined to do so, based on past experiences. After his second incarceration, he was out of prison for only 10 days before reoffending. What is my ethical responsibility to my son, whom I adopted when he was 6, who is Black (I am not), but whose life has shown no improvement from Day 1 despite my considerable best efforts over many years?”</em></p><p><em>In his response, the Ethicist noted: “Of the things he’s asking for, legal representation seems the most important. A privately retained criminal attorney, paid for out of that dwindling trust fund, will probably be able to devote more time and resources to his case than a public defender could. Commissary money can go toward what most people consider basic necessities (soap, shampoo, toilet paper). And you’d be lifting one of the barriers to his reintegration after he leaves prison if you allowed the trust fund to pay for the court fines. Care packages, however, seem more appropriate in a relationship that’s in better shape than yours now is with him.” (Reread the full question and answer </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/magazine/prison-parents-ethics.html\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.)</em></p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"30.5\"><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>As a public defender, I found</strong> the advice to prioritize using the money for a private attorney to be problematic. Public defenders usually provide fantastic representation and are often better than private attorneys who have less experience. Public defenders have relationships with judges and prosecutors, and have deep knowledge of the system from their amount of cases and time in the same courthouses. <em>—</em> <em>Nikki</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I felt for the mom until</strong> she felt the need to point out that her “adopted” son was Black. I’m Black and was adopted by parents who are white. I have never heard my parents refer to me as their “adopted daughter.” That right there threw up a red flag. Then when she pointed out her son was Black, I was horrified. Is this necessary for the conversation? <em>—</em> <em>Kristin</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>The Ethicist completely</strong> failed to recognize the significance of the trust. It is a special needs trust. The parent’s obligations toward the son — and the reciprocal obligations of the son to the parent — must be analyzed in light of the special needs this man has. I realize the letter did not provide information about this man’s needs, but the Ethicist should not have overlooked so salient a factor in the analysis. <em>—</em> <em>Michael</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>It seems that</strong> this mom has an in-house expert consultant. What does that sibling recommend? Speaking of that sibling, there is a comparative hierarchy in the letter between a “good” child and the one “ bad” child that is troubling, and may have always been present. At this moment, this young man is the most in need of compassion, not the least. <em>—</em> <em>Bonnie</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>It’s important to remember</strong> that addiction is an illness. The son’s addiction and drug use are not character flaws, but symptoms. So sending your child, who you presumably love, care packages and giving him part of his trust fund for commissary doesn’t seem like enabling, but showing love to a person who needs to be loved despite his bad behavior. <em>—</em> <em>Patricia</em></p></div></section>",

You’ve got responsibilities to him, because his welfare is a special concern of yours. At the same time, he has responsibilities to you, and clearly he has not met them. Of the things he’s asking for, legal representation seems the most important. A privately retained criminal attorney, paid for out of that dwindling trust fund, will probably be able to devote more time and resources to his case than a public defender could. Commissary money can go toward what most people consider basic necessities (soap, shampoo, toilet paper). And you’d be lifting one of the barriers to his reintegration after he leaves prison if you allowed the trust fund to pay for the court fines.</p><p>Care packages, however, seem more appropriate in a relationship that’s in better shape than yours now is with him. Especially given your son’s history of addiction and self-sabotaging behavior, it’s important to set clear boundaries. You mentioned that his was a transracial adoption, as are perhaps 30 percent of domestic adoptions in the U.S., and perhaps you did so because you wonder whether that circumstance made his integration into your family more difficult or his sense of identity less secure. This is a complex topic, but the preponderance of the research hasn’t found an especially high rate of emotional or behavioral problems among transracial adoptees. And of course, this child has long been an adult. You want to give your son opportunities to live a better life, but enabling deceit and misconduct helps neither of you. If he continues to fail you and himself, you may have to part ways.</p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.9794520547945202\" morss_score=\"22.91858248957713\"><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous column’s question was from a woman whose ex-partner refused to delete images of her father’s corpse.

Perhaps, in your judgment, this family wouldn’t have used the image of a white person of their class background in this way. If so, then this was indeed a case of the “racially based disregard for the welfare of certain people” that the philosopher Jorge L. A. Garcia once identified as “the heart of racism.”</p></div><p>Perhaps you feel that even if the family would have treated pictures of a deceased white person in the same manner, doing so would have been less unseemly because of the history of the abuse of images of Black suffering and death by white people (not least the lynching photographs that circulated around the turn of the 20th century). An awareness of that history may well have conditioned your response. Still, they were seeing these images in the context of a family member’s visit to the funeral of a partner. Details matter, and not knowing exactly how your ex’s family reacted to the pictures, I can’t say whether your appalled response was justified.</p><p>What’s incontestable is that you’ve been greatly pained by what happened. Whether or not your ex understood your reaction, they should have complied with your request. Your ex doesn’t own these images and isn’t entitled to circulate them without permission. Indeed, the person who took the photographs could formally register the copyright, and a lawyer’s letter could be sent giving formal notice that the copyright holder asks that these images not be reproduced or publicly circulated. That would at least further underline the seriousness with which you regard the issue.</p><p>Given that these images don’t seem to have been further circulated, though, it’s unclear what grounds you’d have for pursuing legal action. How would you even establish their continued existence? Which brings us to a curious feature of your situation. At any point, your ex could simply have claimed to have deleted them; you had no way to verify this claim. Yet you’ve been denied this assurance, real or spurious.

For more than a year, I’ve heard the oldest, a boy who is about 4, desperately sobbing and screaming at least once every day, often for up to 45 minutes at a time.

What to do? </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>There are many subcultures in our society, and they don’t all agree about child-rearing. Not all these disagreements, however, can be treated as variations among acceptable options. And you have strong evidence that something has gone wrong in this child’s life.</p><p>One subcultural variation, of course, is in the degree to which people think that the rearing of their children might be anybody else’s business. As I’ve <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/magazine/dog-walker-politics-ethics.html\" title=\"\">mentioned</a> in previous columns, I grew up in a place where the adults in our neighborhood (not least the many older women honored as “aunties”) accepted some responsibility for any children they encountered. Against that West African background, telling parents they’re being too hard on their children is an acceptable form of neighborly communication. I doubt the family next door will share this view. It’s possible that an anonymous note of the kind you’re contemplating will obliquely signal to them that they’ve violated the social norms of their community. But so much of child rearing takes place in private that it’s hard to be sanguine about this.</p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"20.5\"><p>Calling social services isn’t something to be done lightly, but if what you describe is indeed occurring regularly, a child is being seriously mistreated. Even if the social-services experts look into the matter and decide not to do anything, the family might gain some instruction, and you will have done your duty.</p><h2>A Bonus Question</h2><p><em>I have been asked by a major economic-development institution to participate in a mission to improve the labor-market information in an undemocratic country with a poor human rights record. I believe that a better-functioning labor market will be beneficial for the country’s citizens and perhaps help hasten democracy there. I cannot be sure, however, that the data that I would recommend them to collect would only be used for the public good and be immune from manipulation. I would certainly strongly advise the use of measures to protect survey respondents and ensure that they can respond accurately. But the country lacks the democratic institutions that would enforce these protections. What’s more, improvements for the populace could strengthen the current regime’s power, instead of hastening democracy.</em></p><p><em>Should I refuse to participate in this project, or do I participate and do what I can to help the lives of the people living in this country? </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>The project is going ahead with or without you, and your participation could mitigate some of its possible downsides. So, from a consequentialist perspective, participating is the better choice. Consequences aren’t all that matters, to be sure. It’s perfectly reasonable to decide that you’re not the kind of person who would participate in a vile project, even if your participation would make the outcome slightly better. (The philosopher Bernard Williams, in an influential discussion of integrity, posed the example of a chemist who was reluctant to take a job involved with chemical and biological weapons, even if he, unlike an alternate candidate, might be able to slow down the weapons program a bit.) I don’t see this as being an issue here, however. The project may lead to some bad effects, but it’s being done with good intentions. It sounds as if the development institution and the people of the nation in question will be lucky to have you on the job.</p></div><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous column’s question was from a couple frustrated with a grandchild’s lack of gratitude for their financial assistance and birthday presents. They support all their grandchildren equally, and wrote: “All have been appreciative, except for the youngest, who is 17 and a senior in high school. … At family get-togethers, she is openly effusive in greeting her aunts, uncle and cousins, but ignores us unless we approach her. Can we discuss this with our granddaughter despite her mother’s admonition and recommendation to ‘leave it alone’?”</em></p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.9863325740318905\" morss_score=\"39.421517759217075\"><p><em>In his response, the Ethicist suggested a tactful conversation with the granddaughter: “Even if she senses she is not treating you properly, making this explicit could easily backfire: People often respond with resentment when the person they have wronged points out the wrongdoing. If there’s a conversation to be had, it shouldn’t be accusatory or aggrieved; you can ask if you’ve done anything to make her feel distant from you, while emphasizing how much you care about her. … Precisely because your financial generosity to your granddaughter is an expression of familial love, it shouldn’t be part of this discussion.” (Reread the full question and answer </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/magazine/thank-you-notes-ethics.html\" title=\"\"><em>here.</em></a><em>)</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>The Ethicist’s response was good, but</strong> the young woman’s objection could be to a concern that the larger family does not recognize, like something religious, political or cultural. Or she may equate their gifts with family control. Avoiding the grandparents might be a clumsy attempt to avoid a conflict she doesn’t know how to handle — or knows she can’t overcome. <em>—</em> <em>Karen</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>It is unwise to</strong> give a gift hoping to get something in return. We give equivalent gifts to each of our grandchildren because we want to. We are delighted when one grandson sends a handwritten thank-you note and let it pass when the others don’t. <em>—</em> <em>Pamela</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Perhaps there’s something else</strong> going on? Have the grandparents inadvertently expressed an opinion (for example about L.G.B.T.Q. issues or religious matters) that makes her afraid to get close to them? A nonthreatening conversation might help to clarify, if she’s willing to share at all. — <em>Linda</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I agree wholeheartedly that</strong> conversations are the best way to address problems. The grandparents should approach their granddaughter but not bring up any financial concerns. She might benefit from hearing directly that they love her and know how now is a difficult time to be a teenager. Frankness, when done skillfully, is both ethical and polite. <em>—</em> <em>Russell</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I gravitate to what seems the bigger issue:</strong> Is the grandparents’ generosity a true gift — that is, a gift with no strings attached? Or is it really a “transactional” gift that requires some kind of reciprocity? If it’s a true gift, let it be so, and be grateful in the giving. If it really is a transaction, be upfront and let the family know there are expectations for the financial assistance. Be clear about the rules of engagement. If the grandparents expect something in return, I think it’s only fair that the granddaughter knows this. <em>—</em> <em>Vincent</em></p><hr><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

Fortunately, we have had the ability to be financially generous with our family and have established educational trusts for each of our grandchildren’s college tuition. All of our grandchildren have been appreciative, except for the youngest, who is 17 and a senior in high school. She never thanked us for funding her educational trust, and she has also neglected to thank us for the birthday gifts we have given her the past several years. At family get-togethers, she is openly effusive in greeting her aunts, uncle and cousins, but ignores us unless we approach her.</em></p><p><em>We’ve discussed this situation with our daughter (her mother) and have asked her if we’ve done something to antagonize this granddaughter. She tells us no, and that her daughter is just being a teenager. (Our other daughters agree with this assessment too.) We love our granddaughter and admire her accomplishments, but we are hurt by what appears to be her deliberate ignoring of our presence. My concern is not only with our feelings, but with her seeming failure to understand that her behavior is hurtful. I think that this kind of uncaring behavior from a high school senior is immature and mean spirited.</em></p><p><em>Our daughter discourages us from talking to our granddaughter about our frustration. We’ve considered withholding our annual donation to her college fund and limiting the value of her birthday gift, but we both agree that would be petty (and mean spirited as well). Can we discuss this with our granddaughter despite her mother’s admonition and recommendation to “leave it alone”? Do we wait until she’s 18 to discuss this adult to adult? </em>Names Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>There are a couple of distinct issues, as you recognize, in deciding whether or not to take up your granddaughter’s treatment of you directly with her. One is what to make of her behavior. Your daughter says she’s just being a teenager, but learning the consequences of one’s behavior — in this case, the bruised feelings of loving grandparents — can help teenagers mature. You have an independent relationship with this teenager; if you think your daughter’s recommendation is mistaken, you can tell her so and let her know you’re going to talk to your granddaughter about your concerns. She’s old enough to enlist in the military and old enough to understand how you feel; the fact that she is some months shy of becoming a legal adult makes no real difference.</p></div><p>It could be that your daughter has her reasons for wanting you to refrain. Usually, parents prod their children toward politeness: send your cousin that thank-you note, give your aunt a hug. Regardless of whether your granddaughter enjoys your company, she could easily be civil. Have you, unknowingly, offended the teenager in ways your daughter doesn’t want to bring up? If your daughter <em>has</em> tried to correct her, the effort obviously hasn’t been very successful. Is the child resisting her mother’s promptings? Or is your daughter’s real concern simply that you’ll mishandle the conversation?</p><p>Which brings us to the second question you raise. What will the effect be on your relationship with your granddaughter? Even if she senses she is not treating you properly, making this explicit could easily backfire: People often respond with resentment when the person they have wronged points out the wrongdoing. If there’s a conversation to be had, it shouldn’t be accusatory or aggrieved; you can ask if you’ve done anything to make her feel distant from you, while emphasizing how much you care about her.</p><p>Precisely because your financial generosity to your granddaughter is an expression of familial love, it shouldn’t be part of this discussion. The real problem with reducing your largess is that if she then mended her ways, you would all end up wondering whether you had effectively purchased her displays of affection. This could permanently damage your relationship with her. Authentic gratitude is what you’re entitled to, and it isn’t for sale.</p><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous newsletter’s question was from someone who wanted advice on how to nudge in-laws not to bring their dog with them when they visited: “Shouldn’t they just accept the fact that not everyone is comfortable with a pet and find ways to leave it at home (for a few hours) instead of taking it with them everywhere they go? … How can we delicately and politely let them know without hurting their feelings?”</em></p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.9811912225705326\" morss_score=\"28.39369122257053\"><p><em>In his response, the Ethicist encouraged candor: “Your in-laws can’t take your aversion into account if you don’t tell them about it. Your indirect hinting is clearly a dog whistle they’re unable to hear. Being truly courteous calls for being clear: You want to see them without their furry companion. At this point, you may have to explain why you didn’t convey your concerns earlier, and you may not be able to avoid hurt feelings altogether.” (Reread the full question and answer </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/magazine/pets-ethics.html\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I love pets and have always had them</strong>. My dog Violet means a great deal to me. However, I’ve never had the audacity to drag them with me while visiting friends and family. It’s an uncomfortable situation for both pets and people. This couple has every right to expect that their loved ones ask each time if dogs are allowed before visiting, and they shouldn’t feel bad for doing so. <em>—</em> <em>Lisa</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I agree with the Ethicist, but</strong> I noticed that he did not talk about why it was the letter writer who has to communicate these boundaries, as opposed to her husband. She says she hates to bring it up to him. But it is his brother with whom the problem exists. Why wouldn’t they share the responsibility for this? <em>—</em> <em>Shari</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Dogs are like children</strong> to most dog owners. Unless the dog is aggressive or otherwise troublesome, I would suggest the hosts do their best to accommodate the pet just as they would a child. Yes, they’re not the same, but tell that to a dog owner. Is it really worth ostracizing someone over this just because your husband and children “aren’t incredibly fond of pets?” <em>—</em> <em>Kevin</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I’ve come to the conclusion</strong> that it’s never the pet that is the problem, but rather the owner. Some owners are in over their heads and others are simply oblivious to the (negative) impact their pets have on others. In this instance, the owners are oblivious. My experience with obliviousness is that it requires the proverbial sledgehammer to get the message across. Good luck talking nice. <em>—</em> <em>Todd</em></p></div><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I was so disappointed</strong> that this question was even included in The Ethicist column. I am hard-pressed to think of any situation that would ethically require someone to accept an animal that is not theirs into their home. So instead of an ethics question, our columnist is left settling a case of manners. I suspect that this letter was printed because of an abundance of similar questions sent in, and so to all of those writers, I say, “Stand up for yourself!” <em>—</em> <em>Andy</em></p><hr><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

The photos were of him at home, peaceful in bed; my mother wanted to tenderly remember him both in life and in his death. My partner at the time uploaded these photos to their computer, storing these and other images in their cloud server as we archived memories from the trip home to say goodbye to my father.</em></p><p><em>One evening later that year, my then-partner pulled up the photos and did a slide show of our trip for their family. When my partner got to the images of my father’s dead body, they went through every image instead of skipping over them. It was immensely painful, compounded by the fact that my father is a Black man and these images were being shown to an affluent white family. The race and class dynamics here were staggering — it felt as if this white family was viewing these images as entertainment. This was among the incidents that triggered my ending the relationship; my ex didn’t quite understand why this was inappropriate or painful.</em></p><p><em>As we were breaking up, I asked that they erase the images from their drive. Since that time, they’ve made a million excuses as to why they can’t erase the images — the drive is in storage, they’ve moved, etc. It’s now been nearly six years. Still, I am deeply disturbed by the lack of control I have over these images. Currently my ex lives in the U.K., and I live in the U.S. What is the correct course of action here? Do I let it go? Seek legal action? My great fear is that these images will circulate into the future without my or my family’s consent. </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>Your letter raises a number of issues, not least about your and your ex’s differing experiences of this slide show. Perhaps, in your judgment, this family wouldn’t have used the image of a white person of their class background in this way. If so, then this was indeed a case of the “racially based disregard for the welfare of certain people” that the philosopher Jorge L. A. Garcia once identified as “the heart of racism.”</p></div><p>Perhaps you feel that even if the family would have treated pictures of a deceased white person in the same manner, doing so would have been less unseemly because of the history of the abuse of images of Black suffering and death by white people (not least the lynching photographs that circulated around the turn of the 20th century). An awareness of that history may well have conditioned your response. Still, they were seeing these images in the context of a family member’s visit to the funeral of a partner. Details matter, and not knowing exactly how your ex’s family reacted to the pictures, I can’t say whether your appalled response was justified.</p><p>What’s incontestable is that you’ve been greatly pained by what happened. Whether or not your ex understood your reaction, they should have complied with your request. Your ex doesn’t own these images and isn’t entitled to circulate them without permission. Indeed, the person who took the photographs could formally register the copyright, and a lawyer’s letter could be sent giving formal notice that the copyright holder asks that these images not be reproduced or publicly circulated. That would at least further underline the seriousness with which you regard the issue.</p><p>Given that these images don’t seem to have been further circulated, though, it’s unclear what grounds you’d have for pursuing legal action. How would you even establish their continued existence? Which brings us to a curious feature of your situation. At any point, your ex could simply have claimed to have deleted them; you had no way to verify this claim. Yet you’ve been denied this assurance, real or spurious. You’re not being told no; you’re being told “not yet.” The natural inference is that your ex wants to maintain a status quo in which you’re regularly in touch.</p><p>Letting go of this issue — if you can manage it, psychologically — means letting go of your ex. That’s the main reason I’d urge you to try. Six years after your breakup, your demands, however legitimate, are keeping you in each other’s lives. That outcome may suit your ex. I don’t think it suits you.</p><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous column’s question was from a woman whose neighbors regularly left their young child outside, sometimes in foul weather, screaming and crying.

I can see him from my home-office window, alone outside his house, calling “Mama!” or “Papa!” over and over. Sometimes he’s out in very cold or rainy weather with no coat.</em></p><p><em>I don’t know the family at all, and they’re not chatty. But what I’m seeing is heartbreaking. I’ve thought of leaving an anonymous note with a list of helpful resources for new families and for parents of children with special needs, and at times I just want to call the Department of Children and Families. What to do? </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>There are many subcultures in our society, and they don’t all agree about child-rearing. Not all these disagreements, however, can be treated as variations among acceptable options. And you have strong evidence that something has gone wrong in this child’s life.</p><p>One subcultural variation, of course, is in the degree to which people think that the rearing of their children might be anybody else’s business. As I’ve <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/magazine/dog-walker-politics-ethics.html\" title=\"\">mentioned</a> in previous columns, I grew up in a place where the adults in our neighborhood (not least the many older women honored as “aunties”) accepted some responsibility for any children they encountered. Against that West African background, telling parents they’re being too hard on their children is an acceptable form of neighborly communication. I doubt the family next door will share this view. It’s possible that an anonymous note of the kind you’re contemplating will obliquely signal to them that they’ve violated the social norms of their community. But so much of child rearing takes place in private that it’s hard to be sanguine about this.</p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"20.5\"><p>Calling social services isn’t something to be done lightly, but if what you describe is indeed occurring regularly, a child is being seriously mistreated. Even if the social-services experts look into the matter and decide not to do anything, the family might gain some instruction, and you will have done your duty.</p><h2>A Bonus Question</h2><p><em>I have been asked by a major economic-development institution to participate in a mission to improve the labor-market information in an undemocratic country with a poor human rights record. I believe that a better-functioning labor market will be beneficial for the country’s citizens and perhaps help hasten democracy there. I cannot be sure, however, that the data that I would recommend them to collect would only be used for the public good and be immune from manipulation. I would certainly strongly advise the use of measures to protect survey respondents and ensure that they can respond accurately. But the country lacks the democratic institutions that would enforce these protections. What’s more, improvements for the populace could strengthen the current regime’s power, instead of hastening democracy.</em></p><p><em>Should I refuse to participate in this project, or do I participate and do what I can to help the lives of the people living in this country? </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>The project is going ahead with or without you, and your participation could mitigate some of its possible downsides. So, from a consequentialist perspective, participating is the better choice. Consequences aren’t all that matters, to be sure. It’s perfectly reasonable to decide that you’re not the kind of person who would participate in a vile project, even if your participation would make the outcome slightly better. (The philosopher Bernard Williams, in an influential discussion of integrity, posed the example of a chemist who was reluctant to take a job involved with chemical and biological weapons, even if he, unlike an alternate candidate, might be able to slow down the weapons program a bit.) I don’t see this as being an issue here, however. The project may lead to some bad effects, but it’s being done with good intentions. It sounds as if the development institution and the people of the nation in question will be lucky to have you on the job.</p></div><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous column’s question was from a couple frustrated with a grandchild’s lack of gratitude for their financial assistance and birthday presents.

Or she may equate their gifts with family control. Avoiding the grandparents might be a clumsy attempt to avoid a conflict she doesn’t know how to handle — or knows she can’t overcome. <em>—</em> <em>Karen</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>It is unwise to</strong> give a gift hoping to get something in return. We give equivalent gifts to each of our grandchildren because we want to. We are delighted when one grandson sends a handwritten thank-you note and let it pass when the others don’t. <em>—</em> <em>Pamela</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Perhaps there’s something else</strong> going on? Have the grandparents inadvertently expressed an opinion (for example about L.G.B.T.Q. issues or religious matters) that makes her afraid to get close to them? A nonthreatening conversation might help to clarify, if she’s willing to share at all. — <em>Linda</em></p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"19.5\"><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I agree wholeheartedly that</strong> conversations are the best way to address problems. The grandparents should approach their granddaughter but not bring up any financial concerns. She might benefit from hearing directly that they love her and know how now is a difficult time to be a teenager. Frankness, when done skillfully, is both ethical and polite. <em>—</em> <em>Russell</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I gravitate to what seems the bigger issue:</strong> Is the grandparents’ generosity a true gift — that is, a gift with no strings attached? Or is it really a “transactional” gift that requires some kind of reciprocity? If it’s a true gift, let it be so, and be grateful in the giving. If it really is a transaction, be upfront and let the family know there are expectations for the financial assistance. Be clear about the rules of engagement. If the grandparents expect something in return, I think it’s only fair that the granddaughter knows this. <em>—</em> <em>Vincent</em></p><hr><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

Fortunately, we have had the ability to be financially generous with our family and have established educational trusts for each of our grandchildren’s college tuition. All of our grandchildren have been appreciative, except for the youngest, who is 17 and a senior in high school. She never thanked us for funding her educational trust, and she has also neglected to thank us for the birthday gifts we have given her the past several years. At family get-togethers, she is openly effusive in greeting her aunts, uncle and cousins, but ignores us unless we approach her.</em></p><p><em>We’ve discussed this situation with our daughter (her mother) and have asked her if we’ve done something to antagonize this granddaughter. She tells us no, and that her daughter is just being a teenager. (Our other daughters agree with this assessment too.) We love our granddaughter and admire her accomplishments, but we are hurt by what appears to be her deliberate ignoring of our presence. My concern is not only with our feelings, but with her seeming failure to understand that her behavior is hurtful. I think that this kind of uncaring behavior from a high school senior is immature and mean spirited.</em></p><p><em>Our daughter discourages us from talking to our granddaughter about our frustration. We’ve considered withholding our annual donation to her college fund and limiting the value of her birthday gift, but we both agree that would be petty (and mean spirited as well). Can we discuss this with our granddaughter despite her mother’s admonition and recommendation to “leave it alone”? Do we wait until she’s 18 to discuss this adult to adult? </em>Names Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>There are a couple of distinct issues, as you recognize, in deciding whether or not to take up your granddaughter’s treatment of you directly with her. One is what to make of her behavior. Your daughter says she’s just being a teenager, but learning the consequences of one’s behavior — in this case, the bruised feelings of loving grandparents — can help teenagers mature. You have an independent relationship with this teenager; if you think your daughter’s recommendation is mistaken, you can tell her so and let her know you’re going to talk to your granddaughter about your concerns. She’s old enough to enlist in the military and old enough to understand how you feel; the fact that she is some months shy of becoming a legal adult makes no real difference.</p></div><p>It could be that your daughter has her reasons for wanting you to refrain. Usually, parents prod their children toward politeness: send your cousin that thank-you note, give your aunt a hug. Regardless of whether your granddaughter enjoys your company, she could easily be civil. Have you, unknowingly, offended the teenager in ways your daughter doesn’t want to bring up? If your daughter <em>has</em> tried to correct her, the effort obviously hasn’t been very successful. Is the child resisting her mother’s promptings? Or is your daughter’s real concern simply that you’ll mishandle the conversation?</p><p>Which brings us to the second question you raise. What will the effect be on your relationship with your granddaughter? Even if she senses she is not treating you properly, making this explicit could easily backfire: People often respond with resentment when the person they have wronged points out the wrongdoing. If there’s a conversation to be had, it shouldn’t be accusatory or aggrieved; you can ask if you’ve done anything to make her feel distant from you, while emphasizing how much you care about her.</p><p>Precisely because your financial generosity to your granddaughter is an expression of familial love, it shouldn’t be part of this discussion. The real problem with reducing your largess is that if she then mended her ways, you would all end up wondering whether you had effectively purchased her displays of affection. This could permanently damage your relationship with her. Authentic gratitude is what you’re entitled to, and it isn’t for sale.</p><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous newsletter’s question was from someone who wanted advice on how to nudge in-laws not to bring their dog with them when they visited: “Shouldn’t they just accept the fact that not everyone is comfortable with a pet and find ways to leave it at home (for a few hours) instead of taking it with them everywhere they go? … How can we delicately and politely let them know without hurting their feelings?”</em></p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.9811912225705326\" morss_score=\"28.39369122257053\"><p><em>In his response, the Ethicist encouraged candor: “Your in-laws can’t take your aversion into account if you don’t tell them about it.

My dog Violet means a great deal to me. However, I’ve never had the audacity to drag them with me while visiting friends and family. It’s an uncomfortable situation for both pets and people. This couple has every right to expect that their loved ones ask each time if dogs are allowed before visiting, and they shouldn’t feel bad for doing so. <em>—</em> <em>Lisa</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I agree with the Ethicist, but</strong> I noticed that he did not talk about why it was the letter writer who has to communicate these boundaries, as opposed to her husband. She says she hates to bring it up to him. But it is his brother with whom the problem exists. Why wouldn’t they share the responsibility for this? <em>—</em> <em>Shari</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Dogs are like children</strong> to most dog owners. Unless the dog is aggressive or otherwise troublesome, I would suggest the hosts do their best to accommodate the pet just as they would a child. Yes, they’re not the same, but tell that to a dog owner. Is it really worth ostracizing someone over this just because your husband and children “aren’t incredibly fond of pets?” <em>—</em> <em>Kevin</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I’ve come to the conclusion</strong> that it’s never the pet that is the problem, but rather the owner. Some owners are in over their heads and others are simply oblivious to the (negative) impact their pets have on others. In this instance, the owners are oblivious. My experience with obliviousness is that it requires the proverbial sledgehammer to get the message across. Good luck talking nice. <em>—</em> <em>Todd</em></p></div><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I was so disappointed</strong> that this question was even included in The Ethicist column. I am hard-pressed to think of any situation that would ethically require someone to accept an animal that is not theirs into their home. So instead of an ethics question, our columnist is left settling a case of manners. I suspect that this letter was printed because of an abundance of similar questions sent in, and so to all of those writers, I say, “Stand up for yourself!” <em>—</em> <em>Andy</em></p><hr><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

As the philosopher Elizabeth Anderson has argued, a company has duties to its employees that derive from the fact that it exercises power over them, just as a state has duties to its citizens that derive from the fact that it exercises power over them. That is what’s wrong with the default legal assumption in almost all U.S. states that employment is “at will” and that, in the absence of a contract, we can be let go without any reason. (There are, to be sure, a medley of legally impermissible reasons for firing people — pregnancy, race, gender, religion, disability status, refusal to break the law, for example — though the details vary by state.)</p><p>Still, your central task, in supervising an employee, is to ensure that he is actually doing the job to the standard required. Your letter suggests that you have shown proper concern for him; in fact, you have done more than many companies would and, at least in some respects, more than you had a duty to do. I assume that you’ve told him clearly what you think is wrong with his performance and have allowed him an opportunity to improve. Giving him notice would then be acceptable; bad employees put a burden on good ones. I can’t tell you what would count as a decent post-bereavement interval — a few weeks? a couple of months? — but you’ll have to balance your firm’s needs with your sense of compassion, and that’s always a difficult business.</p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.9805825242718447\" morss_score=\"22.909875453564773\"><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous newsletter’s question was from an American parent asking about the ethics of sending an 8-year-old adopted son’s DNA to a genetic ancestry database in the hope of finding his biological parents in China. The parent wrote: “A few years ago, I began to take an interest in locating his birthparents. … He has [also] expressed some interest in locating his birth family, and he has a right to understand his origins. I have enough concern about privacy, however, that DNA ancestry is not something I would choose to do for myself. … What should I do?”</em></p><p><em>In his response, the Ethicist noted: “Your odds of success would seem to be extremely low in any case. The Nanchang Project, which aims to reconnect adoptees with their families in China, [only just] had its first successful match. … It’s true that there are effectively no restrictions on the Chinese government’s use of genetic data. But assuming that your son is planning to live outside China, you may not need to worry much. … Once you’ve got a firm sense of options, you can talk about them with your 8-year-old. Then it’s up to you whether to get out the swab.” (Reread the full question and answer </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/magazine/adopted-child-dna-biological-parents-ethics.html\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>As a Chinese adoptee,</strong> I strongly urge you to consider postponing this decision until your child is older. His feelings about his adoption experience will likely morph with time, and it should be up to him to determine how, when and to what extent he engages with his heritage. The best way you can support him is to let him lead. <em>—</em> <em>Sarah</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>The Ethicist’s response</strong> seemed to veer into the practicalities of testing more than the ethics of doing it. Unless there is evidence of immediate medical need, this is a decision that should be made by the child. The adoptive parent has no skin in this game — beyond curiosity — and it is an irreversible action. Genetic information cannot be retroactively withheld once divulged. <em>—</em> <em>David</em></p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"25.0\"><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Another benefit to</strong> testing your son could be to find a match for a sibling. Yes, he is young. But go for it! I have a full sibling, albeit not international, and am still looking for a half sibling. By searching now, it normalizes the conversation from a young age. <em>—</em> <em>Beverly</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>As both an adoptee and adoptive mother,</strong> I’ve found that gaining medical knowledge is a surefire contribution to quality of life. Money spent on a birth parent search via DNA would be better spent on having his DNA sequenced and checked for genetically linked diseases. None of us adoptees have real health records, nor do we know how our biological relatives died. Direct your money there. <em>—</em> <em>Janet</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>We adopted a daughter from</strong> South Korea over 23 years ago. Our feeling was that any desire to locate her birth parents needed to be driven by her, not our own interests. It takes a number of years for an adopted child to understand not only what they really want, but also what the repercussions are for the “found” family. Be careful that your interest doesn’t outweigh — or outpace — your child’s. <em>—</em> <em>Deb</em></p><hr><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

Apatanis principally use three rice varieties: Emeo, Pyape and Mypia.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/vale-of-apatanis-56032\">Vale of Apatanis</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The total area of the Apatani Plateau is 10,135 square kilometres, where rice-fish culture is undertaken approximately in 592.0 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice lands out of 715.7 ha.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau is a land of diverse cultures. The major festivals of Apatanis are the Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung. People here believe that these traditional festivals ensure better productivity and well-being.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from humid subtropical to temperate. So, this plateau receives adequate rainfall during the summer season. The permeability and water-retaining capacity of the clayey, loamy soil favour this unique farming technique.</p>\n<p>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a low-input and eco-friendly practice. The stocked fish practically depend on the natural food sources of the rice fields and thus, farmers hardly need to use any supplementary fish feeds.</p>\n<p>The farmers sometimes use household and agricultural wastes and excreta of domestic animals like pigs, cows, mithun (<em>Bos frontalis</em>) and goats to make farming more sustainable and organic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, azolla and lemna are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers. The organic food grown in the field plays an essential role in feeding fish.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/recognise-empower-indigenous-land-tenure-and-title-to-achieve-sdgs-holistically-un-report-75997\">Recognise, empower indigenous land tenure and title to achieve SDGs holistically: UN Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The water sources in these high-altitude rice fields are mountain streams and rainwater trickled down during the monsoon season.</p>\n<p>Bamboo pipes are being used to distribute water from the networks of earthen irrigation channels using two outlet pipes. An outlet is fitted angularly at the upper level through a dyke to maintain the water level and another outlet is fitted at the bottom of the dyke to the exterior. It is used for dewatering the field during harvest.</p>\n<p>Men and women perform different farm duties while preparing the fields for cultivating rice. And during the culture of fish, women folk participate as the major workforce.</p>\n<p>Ancient and old-fashioned agricultural technologies are utilised for cultivation. Modern tools like tractors and power tillers are not affordable as well as inaccessible to the farmers.</p>\n<p>They mostly use agricultural tools such as <em>Dao</em> (sickle) and dibbling sticks. After preparing the field, they transplant a maximum of two-three healthy rice plants with an average distance of 26 cm from each other.</p>\n<p><span>Fish refuges are also created inside the fields. Three strains of fish species of common carp — </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiospecularis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpio communis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpionudus — </span></em><span>are stocked just after ten days from transplanting rice.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492\">Sustainable rice production key to food security</a></span></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The stocked fish are harvested twice in a season. The first and second or final harvest is done in the middle of July and October, respectively. But the rice is harvested at the end of September until the mid of October, i.e. once in a season.</span></p>\n<p><span>Four cultivars of rice are grown along with fish species of </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiol</span></em><span>. The total productivity ranges from 300-500 kilograms of fish per hectare in one season (ha-1 season-1) and 3,000-4,000 kg of rice (ha-1 season-1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish enhances rice productivity (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the mineralisation of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances rice yield here. The records of rice and fish yields were obtained from the farmers through personal interviews.</span></p>\n<p>Dykes at a higher elevation and lower elevation are constructed with a height of 0.9 m to 1.5 m and 0.4 to 0.6 m. These dykes are also used to remove water from the field during harvesting. Bamboo fencing is done to avoid the escape of fish through the pipes.</p>\n<p>This eco-friendly and economically beneficial practice has made the system unique in terms of aquatic resource utilisation.</p>\n<p>The zooplankton and algal life forms serve as natural food sources for the fish in the flooded rice fields to enhance aquatic productivity. This ecosystem service, in turn, indirectly maintains healthy human-made swamps with better livelihood options for tribal framers.</p>\n<p>Field water depth is the limiting factor. All the agro-inputs in this ecosystem with organic manures, decomposed rice stubbles and macrophytes, along with other biotic and abiotic factors, regulate their various population properties in the inundated rice fields.</p>\n<p>For growth and development, the stocked fish in the rice field may have utilised and assimilated available aquatic biomass and zooplankton through trophic interactions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, high-altitude flooded environments enriched with such natural fish feeds have sufficient scope to raise fish as a concurrent crop of rice in the same field.</p>\n<p>In the context of plankton and other fish food organisms, the wet rice fields are still data deficient. The water quality parameters, community structure and population dynamics of algal life forms under the rice canopy are favourable for the growth and abundance of zooplankton, which greatly influences the fish yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such unique integrated farming systems require special attention for better productivity and profitability to the small-scale rural farmers in Assam and other northeastern hill states.</p>\n<h3>Read more:</h3>\n<p><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of</em> Down To Earth</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

A farmer can be termed as the first person to be impacted by climate change since s/he is in a livelihood that directly depends on climate.</p>\n<p>This affects the country’s overall agricultural output and also adds to food inflation. High food prices could result in people slashing down consumption as well. This, on the other hand, impacts negatively on nutritional security.</p>\n<p>Among farming households, a significant number produce food for their own consumption. These households gave birth to the old saying that those who eat their own food are also the healthiest ones.</p>\n<p>For countries like India where malnutrition is high and food insecurity is a nagging constant, such households have used the home production system to remain out of it.</p>\n<p>As many studies point out, these households are also protected from market fluctuations thus ensuring their affordability for healthy food. Obviously, they are not impacted by food inflation as well.</p>\n<p>But serious conversations are taking place over how climate change-induced extreme weather events would impact such households. To begin with, we need to know the linkage between nutrition intake and household food production; and whether weather fluctuation would have any impact on this.</p>\n<p>A recent research paper from the <a href=\"https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136557/filename/136768.pdf\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) attempts to answer the first question: How much do weather conditions impact a home food production system?</p>\n<p>Researchers Hiroyuki Takeshima, Sunil Saroj and Anjani Kumar have analysed village-level data from households on their own food production and consumption and correlated the local weather situations to infer whether there was a significant relationship.</p>\n<p>The IFPRI paper first established that people growing their own food consume more, thus adding to nutrition level and also attaining overall food security. “On average, growing grain crops at home led to Rs 12.184 higher average grain consumption per month per household,” found the research paper.</p>\n<p>This trend is not limited only to grains. Consumption increases significantly for pulses, dairy, vegetables and fruits, if grown at home. The research could establish a link between increased consumption and reduction in child stunting, underweight and women achieving normal body-mass-index. These trends are more pronounced in remote villages.</p>\n<p>But these ‘positive effects’ of growing your own food are observed to be ‘significantly magnified’ if the weather is closer to normal. This is the most definitive linkage of climate and food intake established by this research paper among the food-growing households.</p>\n<p>If the rainfall is one standard deviation closer to the normal figure, grain consumption increases by Rs 12.282. Similarly, if the temperature is one standard deviation from normal, consumption increases by Rs 5.723. This also means that normal weather will increase all other physical benefits.</p>\n<p>This implies that if these households experience adverse weather conditions, their overall food and nutritional security would be negatively impacted. Also, without normal weather, they may have to depend more on markets thus spending more on food than before. This would have an impact on overall economic well being.</p>\n<p>This makes the case for climate-proofing these food producers who till now remain untouched from the crisis. Moreover, these are the people who are yet to be impacted by the market-driven agriculture system. While climate change takes all under its grips, this system of food production needs a prudent reaction.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

The paper, titled</span><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12152-023-09516-3\"> <span>‘Merging Minds: The Conceptual and Ethical Impacts of Emerging Technologies for Collective Minds’</span></a><span>, was just published in </span><i><span>Neuroethics</span></i><span>, and is freely available as an Open Access article through the link above.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the paper, we argue that the received views on how we (should) ascribe responsibility to individuals and collectives map poorly onto networks of these ‘Collective Minds’. The intimately collective nature of direct multiple-brain interfaces, for instance, where human minds can collaborate on and complete complex tasks without necessarily being in the same room – or even on the same continent! –  seem to suggest a collectivist moral framework to ascribe agency and responsibility. However, the technologies we are seeing in R&amp;D do not necessitate the meeting of criteria we normally would turn to for ascription of such frameworks; they do not, for instance, seem to rely on that participants have shared goals, know what the goals of other participants are, or even know whether they are collaborating with another person or a computer.</span> </p>\n<p><span>In anticipating and assessing the ethical impacts of Collective Minds, we propose that we move beyond binary approaches to thinking about agency and responsibility (i.e. that they are either individual or collective), and that relevant frameworks for now focus on other aspects of significance to ethical analysis, such as (a) technical specifications of the Collective Mind, (b) the domain in which the technology is deployed, and (c) the reversibility of its physical and mental impacts. However, in the future, we will arguably need to find other ways to assess agency constellations and responsibility distribution, lest we abandon these concepts completely in this domain.</span></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk%2F2023%2F03%2Fhow-brain-to-brain-interfaces-will-make-things-difficult-for-us%2F&amp;t=How%20Brain-to-Brain%20Interfaces%20Will%20Make%20Things%20Difficult%20for%20Us\"><img src=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/plugins/sociable-30/pro/images/komodo/32/facebook.png\" title=\"Facebook\"></a></li><li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=How%20Brain-to-Brain%20Interfaces%20Will%20Make%20Things%20Difficult%20for%20Us%20-%20http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/how-brain-to-brain-interfaces-will-make-things-difficult-for-us/\"><img src=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/plugins/sociable-30/pro/images/komodo/32/twitter.png\" title=\"Twitter\"></a></li><li><a href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk%2F2023%2F03%2Fhow-brain-to-brain-interfaces-will-make-things-difficult-for-us%2F&amp;title=How%20Brain-to-Brain%20Interfaces%20Will%20Make%20Things%20Difficult%20for%20Us\"><img src=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/plugins/sociable-30/pro/images/komodo/32/reddit.png\" title=\"Reddit\"></a></li></ul>\n</div>\n",

This essay argues that giving luxuries to your children can, in fact, be morally impermissible. The core of my argument is that when parents give their children a luxurious standard of life, they foist an expectation for a higher standard of living upon their children, reducing their lifetime wellbeing if they cannot afford this standard in adulthood.</p>\n<p>I argue for this conclusion in four steps. Firstly, I discuss how one can harm someone by changing their preferences. Secondly, I develop a model for the general permissibility of gift giving in the context of adaptive preferences. Thirdly, I apply this to the case of parental giving, arguing it is uniquely problematic. Lastly, I respond to a series of objections to the main argument.  </p>\n<p>I call the practice in question, <em>luxury parenting</em>. <em>Luxury parenting </em>consists of providing certain luxuries to your child which go beyond a reasonably good standard of living.  I will consider this through a framework of gift giving, since <em>luxury parenting</em> can be understood as the continual gifting of certain luxuries to children. While my argument also applies to singular gifts of luxury to children, it is targeted at the continual provision of luxury goods and services to ensure a high standard of living throughout childhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 1: Preference Screwing</strong></p>\n<p>When we discuss harming one’s wellbeing, we are usually referring to taking some action which changes the actor’s situation so that they are further from their preferences. However, a person’s wellbeing can be harmed in the opposite way as well, by changing their preferences away from their situation. Consider the following example.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Wine pill: </em>Bob secretly administers a pill to Will which changes his preferences so that he no longer enjoys cheap wine.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Will has been harmed here in some morally significant way without having received any immediate disbenefit. The harm consists in the effect on future preferences. We can call this type of harming “<em>preference screwing</em>”.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Preference Screwing:</em> Making it more difficult for an actor to achieve a certain level of utility by changing the actor’s preferences so that there is a larger divergence between the preference set and the actor’s option set.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Section 2: Adaptive Preferences and Gift-giving</strong></p>\n<p>The theory of adaptive preferences tells us that people tend to return to their baseline happiness after positive or negative shocks to their wellbeing because people’s preferences adapt to their current situation. I argue this process of preference adaptation implies that some instances of gift-giving are impermissible, because consuming a high-quality gift, <em>screws</em> with the <em>preferences</em> of the recipient, so that they derive lower utility from future consumption of lower-quality variants of the good they were gifted.</p>\n<p>There exists a vast literature debating the accuracy of adaptive preferences.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/oxford-uehiro-prize-in-practical-ethics-turning-up-the-hedonic-treadmill-is-it-morally-impermissible-for-parents-to-give-their-children-a-luxurious-standard-of-living/#_ftn1\">[1]</a> However, my argument only requires a weak restricted form of adaptive preferences. Namely it simply says that there is some negative impact of consuming expensive goods on the enjoyment of future cheap goods. That such an impact exists is generally empirically supported, even if the strength of the impact is debatable.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/oxford-uehiro-prize-in-practical-ethics-turning-up-the-hedonic-treadmill-is-it-morally-impermissible-for-parents-to-give-their-children-a-luxurious-standard-of-living/#_ftn2\">[2]</a></p>\n<p>It might be objected that if preferences are adaptive, then gift-giving has no long-term harm since, upon returning to the lower-quality good, preferences will adapt downward immediately. There are two independent reasons why this is not a problem for my argument.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I don’t assume (and the empirics don’t support) complete adaption, only partial adaptation. This means that once the preferences of an actor have (partially) adapted up after consuming the higher-quality good, then if the actor returns to the lower-quality good, their preferences will adapt down but not completely, so there remains a long-lasting upwards pressure on their preferences.</p>\n<p>Secondly, as discussed in section 3, since childhood is a formative life-phase, preferences adapt more quickly and more permanently for children. <em>Luxury parenting </em>thus fixes children’s preferences at a high point, which will take much longer to adapt back down in adulthood.</p>\n<p>This allows us to develop a model of gift giving. When A gifts X to B, B’s lifetime wellbeing is affected in two ways. Firstly, there is the immediate positive (or negative if a particularly poor gift) utility derived by B’s consumption of X. Call this the <em>immediate utility</em>. Secondly there is the long-term impact of the gift’s <em>preference screwing. The preference screwing effect</em> is the total harm to the lifetime wellbeing of B incurred by B as a result of the <em>preference screwing</em> caused by consuming X. This allows us to state the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<em>Net wellbeing impact of gift giving = immediate utility – preference screwing effect</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Now, consider that <em>preference screwing </em>through gift-giving is usually not considered a form of wronging. Consider the following example:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Wine gift: </em>Bob gifts a bottle of Château Latour to Will for his birthday. After thoroughly enjoying the wine, Will no longer enjoys cheap wines as much</p></blockquote>\n<p>In <em>wine gift</em>, we would not say that Bob has wronged Will. There are two distinctions between <em>wine gift</em> and <em>wine pill</em> which explain why gift giving to adults is generally permissible.</p>\n<p>Firstly, <em>wine gift</em> is not necessarily a net negative for Will’s lifetime utility. The spike in utility of drinking the gifted bottle may outweigh the loss in utility from the future discounted happiness of drinking cheap wines. In <em>wine pill</em>, there is only a negative impact on Will’s utility (ignoring the health effects).</p>\n<p>Secondly, and crucially, Will consents into receiving the gift. Generally, we think that a person’s potential complaint versus a particular action is much weaker when they consented into that action being conducted upon them.</p>\n<p>This allows us to say that the permissibility of gift given is a function of the following two parameters:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Expected<em> net wellbeing impact of gift giving</em></u> (henceforth <u>expected net impact</u>)</li>\n<li><u>Level of consent</u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The weight given to each is going to vary with one’s background intuitions on paternalism. Anti-paternalists might thus completely disregard the first parameter, arguing that given sufficient consent, gift-giving is always permissible. My argument is inclusive to a broad pluralism on this matter, since it avoids the 2<sup>nd</sup> parameter altogether, as discussed in section 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 3: Giving Children Luxuries</strong></p>\n<p>By evaluating <em>luxury parenting</em> on the two parameters, I argue that many instances of practice are impermissible.</p>\n<p>Firstly, consider <u>level of consent</u>. Children are usually thought to lack the required capacities for autonomous decision making, such as critical thinking, time-relative agency (ownership of future interests) and independence<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/oxford-uehiro-prize-in-practical-ethics-turning-up-the-hedonic-treadmill-is-it-morally-impermissible-for-parents-to-give-their-children-a-luxurious-standard-of-living/#_ftn3\">[3]</a>. This means that children, generally, cannot consent into receiving luxuries from their parents.</p>\n<p>As such, we must adapt the model of consent for children. Brighouse suggests that the autonomy rights of children express themselves as fiduciary duties upon parents.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/oxford-uehiro-prize-in-practical-ethics-turning-up-the-hedonic-treadmill-is-it-morally-impermissible-for-parents-to-give-their-children-a-luxurious-standard-of-living/#_ftn4\">[4]</a> Parents thus have the authority to make decisions for their children, but this authority is limited by the duty to act in the child’s best interest. This means that both parents can permissibly give gifts to children, but only when those gifts appear to be in the best interest of the child. Assume now that, <em>ceteris paribus,</em> the non-welfare interests of children are unaffected in cases of gift giving. Given this assumption, we can say that the permissibility of child gift giving boils down to the <u>expected net impact<em>.</em></u></p>\n<p morss_own_score=\"7.0\" morss_score=\"17.0\"><em>Luxury parenting</em> is thus usually impermissible since it is particularly likely to lead to a negative <u>expected net impact</u>. This is because the <em>preference screwing effect</em> is likely to be strong, while the <em>immediate benefit</em> is small. Children are particularly vulnerable to <em>preference screwing</em> from <em>luxury parenting </em>for four reasons.</p>\n<p>Firstly, childhood is an especially formative stage in life. Due to the ongoing development of the brain, the patterns children learn are going to be extra lasting. <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/oxford-uehiro-prize-in-practical-ethics-turning-up-the-hedonic-treadmill-is-it-morally-impermissible-for-parents-to-give-their-children-a-luxurious-standard-of-living/#_ftn5\">[5]</a> This means that if preferences are formed to expect a high standard of living, these preferences are going to be especially sticky. If the child’s standard of living drops upon reaching adulthood, those preferences will likely adapt down less quickly and won’t adapt down completely.</p>\n<p>Secondly, when children experience certain goods, they often experience them for the first time. If the first time they experience a particular good or service, they are experiencing an expensive variant of that good, they are likely to calibrate their future expectation on this expensive good, because they have no cheaper variants to compare it to.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, children generally will have a lesser appreciation of the uniqueness or scarcity of the goods they experience at a high standard of living. In <em>wine gift,</em> Will is acutely aware that his drinking of Château Latour is a unique and temporary experience. This awareness can deter the preference adaptation. However, children are less likely to be aware of the fleeting nature of the standard of living and so are not protected from preference adaption in this way.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the effect is going to be especially strong because the luxury gifts are provided for an extended period of time. If parents provide a luxurious standard of living for multiple years, that gives a very long time for the child’s preferences to be pushed upwards and solidify there.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, the immediate utility effect is going to be smaller for children. The satisfaction people receive from luxuries often goes beyond the direct experiential joy of the good or service. There is also the novelty of the experience, the secondary reflective happiness from knowing that you are consuming something special. Children are much less likely to appreciate the novelty of the experience since they are likely, as argued above, to be less aware of the uniqueness of the experience.</p>\n<p morss_own_score=\"7.0\" morss_score=\"17.0\">In sum, <em>luxury parenting </em>has strongly negative <em>preferencing screwing effects</em> while it offers a limited positive <em>immediate utility</em>. In turn, <em>luxury parenting </em>is likely to have a negative <u>expected net impact </u>on children, meaning that <em>luxury parenting</em> is often impermissible.</p>\n<p><strong>Section 4: Objections</strong></p>\n<p><em>Objection 1:</em> <em>Symmetry Implications</em></p>\n<p>If it is impermissible to give a luxurious standard of life to children, this could imply that it is morally required to give a miserable existence to children instead. If childhood suffering will push preferences down such that children will be happier in the long run, this may be better for the child. This implication would be so clearly unacceptable that it would condemn the whole argument. However, the implications of the model are asymmetrical. This is because children are generally thought to have significant rights, which ought to be respected. They have rights against being physically harmed and to a reasonable standard of living. Parents cannot impose suffering on their children even if it is a net-positive on lifetime wellbeing because this would violate these rights protections.</p>\n<p>On the flipside, parents can permissibly withdraw these luxury goods, since children generally are not thought to have a right to luxury living.</p>\n<p><em>Objection 2: Shared Time</em></p>\n<p>One might argue that <em>luxury parenting</em> is permissible because it is necessary for parents to give themselves a high quality of life. Parents are generally thought to be under an obligation to spend quality time with their children because a healthy parental relationship is crucial for the child’s development. This is problematic since many opportunities for quality time are also opportunities for parents to spend money on themselves, such as restaurants, vacations, or entertainment. So, if we think parents should be permitted to spend money on themselves, this could make <em>luxury parenting</em> permissible. There are three responses to this objection.</p>\n<p>Firstly, there are still many ways parents can spend on themselves without spending on their children. Parents can spend money on activities without their children or they can spend money on themselves while shielding their children from the same luxury expenditure, for instance by ordering a lobster for yourself and the pasta for your child.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the magnitude of this sacrifice, being unable to spend on oneself, directly correlates with the level of wealth parents have. This makes the sacrifice a less significant problem because the wealth of parents reduces the required sacrifice of parenting significantly in other contexts. Wealthy parents can afford babysitters, summer camps, and meal boxes. This means that the sacrifice of giving up luxury is balanced out by the diminished sacrifice in other facets of parenting.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, parents are routinely asked to make sacrifices for their children in determining how they spend their time. They can only watch child-friendly movies, avoid bars, and go to child-friendly holiday destinations. It’s unclear, for instance, how giving up luxury is materially different from forcing parents to go on vacation to Disneyland.</p>\n<p>In sum, a parent’s interest in treating themselves is insufficient for making <em>luxury parenting</em> permissible.</p>\n<p><strong>Works Cited:</strong></p>\n<p>Bagenstos, Samuel R., and Margo Schlanger. ‘Hedonic Damages, Hedonic Adaptation, and Disability’. <em>Vanderbilt Law Review</em> 60, no. 3 (2007): 745–98.</p>\n<p>Brighouse, Harry. ‘What Rights (If Any) Do Children Have’, 1 January 2002. https://doi.org/10.1093/0199242682.003.0003.</p>\n<p>Coleman, Joe. ‘Answering Susan: Liberalism, Civic Education, and the Status of Younger Persons’.

Apatanis principally use three rice varieties: Emeo, Pyape and Mypia.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/vale-of-apatanis-56032\">Vale of Apatanis</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The total area of the Apatani Plateau is 10,135 square kilometres, where rice-fish culture is undertaken approximately in 592.0 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice lands out of 715.7 ha.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau is a land of diverse cultures. The major festivals of Apatanis are the Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung. People here believe that these traditional festivals ensure better productivity and well-being.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from humid subtropical to temperate. So, this plateau receives adequate rainfall during the summer season. The permeability and water-retaining capacity of the clayey, loamy soil favour this unique farming technique.</p>\n<p>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a low-input and eco-friendly practice. The stocked fish practically depend on the natural food sources of the rice fields and thus, farmers hardly need to use any supplementary fish feeds.</p>\n<p>The farmers sometimes use household and agricultural wastes and excreta of domestic animals like pigs, cows, mithun (<em>Bos frontalis</em>) and goats to make farming more sustainable and organic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, azolla and lemna are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers. The organic food grown in the field plays an essential role in feeding fish.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/recognise-empower-indigenous-land-tenure-and-title-to-achieve-sdgs-holistically-un-report-75997\">Recognise, empower indigenous land tenure and title to achieve SDGs holistically: UN Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The water sources in these high-altitude rice fields are mountain streams and rainwater trickled down during the monsoon season.</p>\n<p>Bamboo pipes are being used to distribute water from the networks of earthen irrigation channels using two outlet pipes. An outlet is fitted angularly at the upper level through a dyke to maintain the water level and another outlet is fitted at the bottom of the dyke to the exterior. It is used for dewatering the field during harvest.</p>\n<p>Men and women perform different farm duties while preparing the fields for cultivating rice. And during the culture of fish, women folk participate as the major workforce.</p>\n<p>Ancient and old-fashioned agricultural technologies are utilised for cultivation. Modern tools like tractors and power tillers are not affordable as well as inaccessible to the farmers.</p>\n<p>They mostly use agricultural tools such as <em>Dao</em> (sickle) and dibbling sticks. After preparing the field, they transplant a maximum of two-three healthy rice plants with an average distance of 26 cm from each other.</p>\n<p><span>Fish refuges are also created inside the fields. Three strains of fish species of common carp — </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiospecularis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpio communis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpionudus — </span></em><span>are stocked just after ten days from transplanting rice.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492\">Sustainable rice production key to food security</a></span></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The stocked fish are harvested twice in a season. The first and second or final harvest is done in the middle of July and October, respectively. But the rice is harvested at the end of September until the mid of October, i.e. once in a season.</span></p>\n<p><span>Four cultivars of rice are grown along with fish species of </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiol</span></em><span>. The total productivity ranges from 300-500 kilograms of fish per hectare in one season (ha-1 season-1) and 3,000-4,000 kg of rice (ha-1 season-1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish enhances rice productivity (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the mineralisation of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances rice yield here. The records of rice and fish yields were obtained from the farmers through personal interviews.</span></p>\n<p>Dykes at a higher elevation and lower elevation are constructed with a height of 0.9 m to 1.5 m and 0.4 to 0.6 m. These dykes are also used to remove water from the field during harvesting. Bamboo fencing is done to avoid the escape of fish through the pipes.</p>\n<p>This eco-friendly and economically beneficial practice has made the system unique in terms of aquatic resource utilisation.</p>\n<p>The zooplankton and algal life forms serve as natural food sources for the fish in the flooded rice fields to enhance aquatic productivity. This ecosystem service, in turn, indirectly maintains healthy human-made swamps with better livelihood options for tribal framers.</p>\n<p>Field water depth is the limiting factor. All the agro-inputs in this ecosystem with organic manures, decomposed rice stubbles and macrophytes, along with other biotic and abiotic factors, regulate their various population properties in the inundated rice fields.</p>\n<p>For growth and development, the stocked fish in the rice field may have utilised and assimilated available aquatic biomass and zooplankton through trophic interactions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, high-altitude flooded environments enriched with such natural fish feeds have sufficient scope to raise fish as a concurrent crop of rice in the same field.</p>\n<p>In the context of plankton and other fish food organisms, the wet rice fields are still data deficient. The water quality parameters, community structure and population dynamics of algal life forms under the rice canopy are favourable for the growth and abundance of zooplankton, which greatly influences the fish yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such unique integrated farming systems require special attention for better productivity and profitability to the small-scale rural farmers in Assam and other northeastern hill states.</p>\n<h3>Read more:</h3>\n<p><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of</em> Down To Earth</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

A farmer can be termed as the first person to be impacted by climate change since s/he is in a livelihood that directly depends on climate.</p>\n<p>This affects the country’s overall agricultural output and also adds to food inflation. High food prices could result in people slashing down consumption as well. This, on the other hand, impacts negatively on nutritional security.</p>\n<p>Among farming households, a significant number produce food for their own consumption. These households gave birth to the old saying that those who eat their own food are also the healthiest ones.</p>\n<p>For countries like India where malnutrition is high and food insecurity is a nagging constant, such households have used the home production system to remain out of it.</p>\n<p>As many studies point out, these households are also protected from market fluctuations thus ensuring their affordability for healthy food. Obviously, they are not impacted by food inflation as well.</p>\n<p>But serious conversations are taking place over how climate change-induced extreme weather events would impact such households. To begin with, we need to know the linkage between nutrition intake and household food production; and whether weather fluctuation would have any impact on this.</p>\n<p>A recent research paper from the <a href=\"https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136557/filename/136768.pdf\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) attempts to answer the first question: How much do weather conditions impact a home food production system?</p>\n<p>Researchers Hiroyuki Takeshima, Sunil Saroj and Anjani Kumar have analysed village-level data from households on their own food production and consumption and correlated the local weather situations to infer whether there was a significant relationship.</p>\n<p>The IFPRI paper first established that people growing their own food consume more, thus adding to nutrition level and also attaining overall food security. “On average, growing grain crops at home led to Rs 12.184 higher average grain consumption per month per household,” found the research paper.</p>\n<p>This trend is not limited only to grains. Consumption increases significantly for pulses, dairy, vegetables and fruits, if grown at home. The research could establish a link between increased consumption and reduction in child stunting, underweight and women achieving normal body-mass-index. These trends are more pronounced in remote villages.</p>\n<p>But these ‘positive effects’ of growing your own food are observed to be ‘significantly magnified’ if the weather is closer to normal. This is the most definitive linkage of climate and food intake established by this research paper among the food-growing households.</p>\n<p>If the rainfall is one standard deviation closer to the normal figure, grain consumption increases by Rs 12.282. Similarly, if the temperature is one standard deviation from normal, consumption increases by Rs 5.723. This also means that normal weather will increase all other physical benefits.</p>\n<p>This implies that if these households experience adverse weather conditions, their overall food and nutritional security would be negatively impacted. Also, without normal weather, they may have to depend more on markets thus spending more on food than before. This would have an impact on overall economic well being.</p>\n<p>This makes the case for climate-proofing these food producers who till now remain untouched from the crisis. Moreover, these are the people who are yet to be impacted by the market-driven agriculture system. While climate change takes all under its grips, this system of food production needs a prudent reaction.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"5.089848308051343\" morss_score=\"111.58984830805134\">\n<p>“We have the reincarnation of Khalkha Jetsun Dhampa Rinpoche of Mongolia with us today,” he told the 600-odd followers at the unveiling ceremony, understood to have taken place on March 8 in Dharamshala, the <em>Times</em> reported.</p><p>The ninth Khalkha Jetsun Dhampa died in 2012 at Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Since then, there had been a tense wait for his reincarnation. In 2016, during the Dalai Lama’s latest visit to Mongolia, he announced that the Jetsun Dhampa had been born in the country and the search was on to find him.</p>\n<p>The boy unveiled, reportedly a scion of one of Ulaanbaatar’s most prominent business and political families, was deemed to be the said reincarnation. He is reportedly one of the twins born to Altannar Chinchuluun, a professor of mathematics at the National University of Mongolia, and Monkhnasan Narmandakh, a chief executive at a business conglomerate.</p>\n<p>The latest announcement has brought attention back to the larger question of the 14th Dalai Lama’s own reincarnation. The Dalai Lama is the foremost spiritual and temporal authority of Tibet. Over the past 70 years of Chinese occupation, he has been Tibet’s loudest, most popular and outspoken voice, while living in exile in Dharamshala, India. This makes the issue of his reincarnation one with deep ramifications on international politics.</p>\n<p>“The Dalai Lama’s reincarnation is a civilizational struggle between China and Tibetans over who controls Tibetan Buddhism,” Amitabh Mathur, a retired adviser to the Indian government on Tibetan affairs, told <em>NPR</em> in 2019.</p>\n<h2>A brief outline of Tibetan Buddhism</h2>\n<p>Buddhism became the predominant religion in Tibet by the 9th century AD. It evolved from the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions of Buddhism, incorporating many tantric and shamanic practices of both post-Gupta period Buddhism in India as well as the Bon religion which was spread across Tibet prior to Buddhism’s arrival.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Tibetan Buddhism has four major schools: Nyingma (8th century), Kagyu (11th century), Sakya (1073), and Gelug (1409). The Janang school (12th century) is one of the smaller schools that grew as an offshoot of the Sakya school. Since 1640, the Gelug school has been the predominant school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai Lama belongs to this school.</p>\n<h2>Hierarchy and Reincarnation in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition</h2>\n<p>The cycle of birth, death and rebirth is one of Buddhism’s key beliefs. “As long as you are a Buddhist, it is necessary to accept past and future rebirth”, the Dalai Lama said in a 2011 sermon on the subject (translated from Tibetan).</p>\n<p>However, early Buddhism did not organise itself on the basis of this belief in reincarnation. In fact, early Buddhist ‘orders’ were scarcely ordered at all – with next to know hierarchy and little organisation. “It was merely a brotherhood of monks”, LA Waddell wrote in his authoritative <em>The Buddhism of Tibet or Lamaism</em> (1895).</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Tibet’s hierarchical system seemingly emerged in the 13th century. It was also around this time that the first instances of “formally recognizing the reincarnations of lamas” can be found. The Dalai Lama traces this tradition to “the recognition of Karmapa Pagshi as the reincarnation of Karmapa Dusum Khyenpa by his disciples in accordance with his prediction”. Since then, this custom slowly spread to all Tibetan traditions.</p>\n<p>Notably, in 1417, Jé Tsongkhapa founded the Gelug school, which developed a strong hierarchy and by 1640 it leapt into the temporal government of Tibet with the assistance of Mongol prince Gusri Khan. The fifth grand lama of the school, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso, was conferred the title of Dalai Lama (‘Dalai’ being the Mongol word for ‘ocean’). To consolidate his rule, he instituted the tradition of succession through reincarnation in the Gelug school, himself claiming to be the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara, one of the most important Bodhisattvas in Mahayana traditions.</p>\n<h2>How reincarnate lamas are chosen</h2>\n<p>Since then, “a series of unmistaken reincarnations has been recognised in the lineage of the Dalai Lama”, the Dalai Lama said in 2011. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the spirit of a deceased lama is reborn in a child. “This secures a continuous line of succession through successive re-embodiments”, John Powers wrote in his book <em>Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism</em> (1995).</p>\n<span><img src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/DalaiLama1.jpg?resize=600,339\"> His Holiness, The 14th Dalai Lama, sitting on the throne during his official enthronement ceremony in Lhasa, Tibet on February 22, 1940. He passed a series of tests before he was recognised as the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. (Photo: The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama)</span>\n<p>A number of procedures are followed in order to recognise Tulkus (recognised reincarnations).</p>\n<p>The predecessor himself leaves guidance regarding his reincarnation. The prospective child then has to undergo multiple ‘tests’ in which they ‘recall’ their past lives and recognise objects that their predecessor used (such as spectacles, prayer beads, etc.) Other oracles and lamas with the power of divination are also consulted before the final proclamation is made.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>There are also procedures to iron out disputes. “When there happens to be more than one prospective candidate for recognition as a Tulku … there is a practice of making the final decision by divination employing the dough-ball method (zen tak) before a sacred image while calling upon the power of truth”, the Dalai Lama said in 2011.</p>\n<p>This system of succession by reincarnation works at various levels of the Buddhist hierarchy.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Chinese interference</h2>\n<p>The Chinese occupation of Tibet and the Dalai Lama’s exile has raised significant complications in the established traditions of reincarnations in Tibetan Buddhism.</p>\n<p>\nWhile China’s initial attempts to establish its authority in Tibet employed direct, repressive tactics (especially during Mao’s Cultural Revolution when thousands of Tibetan monasteries and cultural sites were destroyed), of late, China’s policy has focussed on controlling Tibetan Buddhism itself in order to “pacify the highly devout Tibetan public”.</p><p>Not that China is not repressive anymore. Monasteries are highly surveilled, schools do not teach Tibetan language, culture and history, and dissenting voices often just ‘disappear’. But China has also ‘invested’ millions of dollars to rebuild and renovate many monasteries and recognised Buddhism as an “ancient Chinese religion”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The succession of the Dalai Lama is of utmost importance in this project. For years, the Chinese government has attempted to discredit the Dalai Lama, calling him a “wolf in monk’s robes”, claiming that he forfeited his authority over Tibetans 60 years ago, when he went into exile. However, the Dalai Lama still remains venerated in Tibet, even though the Chinese government has systematically attempted to remove him from public consciousness, including by banning his portrait across China. By controlling his succession, the Chinese seek to, once and for all, take control over Tibetan Buddhism and consequently, Tibetan Buddhists.</p>\n<p>According to the ‘State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5’, passed by the Chinese government in 2007, “a reincarnation application must be filed by all Buddhist temples in that country before they are allowed to recognise individuals as tulkus”.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/patna/missing-chinese-woman-a-spy-story-that-never-was-the-dalai-lama-visit-8352955/\">Missing Chinese woman: A spy story that never was!</a></div>\n<h2>The Dalai Lama’s position</h2>\n<p>On his part, the Dalai Lama has outrightly rejected any authority the Chinese claim to have regarding his and other other lamas’ reincarnation. “The person who reincarnates has sole legitimate authority over where and how he or she takes rebirth and how that reincarnation is to be recognised,” declared the Dalai Lama. He adds, “It is particularly inappropriate for Chinese communists … to meddle in the system of reincarnation and especially the reincarnations of the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas.”</p>\n<p>But, while the Dalai Lama, currently 87, claims he will live till the ripe age of 113 and have enough time to decide upon his reincarnation, his old age and shaky health concern many Tibetans. “If His Holiness leaves this world without certainty about what comes next, there will be trouble”, a devotee told <em>NPR</em>.</p>\n<p>The potential for confusion is aggravated by the fact that the Panchen Lama – traditionally the second most important figure in the Gelug tradition, responsible for naming and grooming the next Dalai Lama – chosen by the 14th Dalai Lama remains ‘missing’ since he was kidnapped by Chinese authorities in 1995. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was only 6 at the time of his abduction and has never been seen since.</p>\n<p>Chinese authorities selected their own Panchen Lama, a six year old boy named Gyaincain Norbu, in 1995. Today, he is the vice-president of the Buddhist Association of China and seen in monasteries across Tibet, spreading pro-China messages.</p>\n<h2>What next?</h2>\n<p>The question of the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation is set to linger on for the foreseeable future. The Dalai Lama himself has not provided a definitive answer regarding what will happen. At different times, he has dodged the question with his disarming smile, claimed that there is ample time to make the decision, and even suggested that there may be no Dalai Lama after him.</p>\n<p>In 2011, announcing his retirement from worldly affairs, the Dalai Lama handed over his temporal authority to an elected Tibetan government-in-exile, the Central Tibetan Administration. <span>“</span>The rule by kings and religious figures is outdated<span>”</span>, he said. The CTA runs as like any modern government with various ministries and a constitution.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>However, given the symbolic authority that the Dalai Lama due to his importance to millions of Tibetans across the world and through the sheer strength of his charisma, the question of his reincarnation continues to hold great political implications.</p>\n</div> ",

They published their research and photos in the open access journal Geophysical Research Letters in December last year.</p>\n<p><strong>The phenomenon of upward lightning</strong></p><p>Upward <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/climate-change-wildfire-hot-lightning-strikes-8482578/#:~:text=Soaring%20global%20temperatures%20could%20lead,ignite%20wildfires%20than%20typical%20lightning.\"><strong>lightning</strong></a> is a phenomenon whereby a self-initiated lightning streak develops from a tall object that travels upward toward an overlaying electrified storm cloud.</p>\n<p>For this to happen, storm electrification and the resulting presence of a cloud charge region are enabling factors. The vertical elevation of a tall object accentuates the electric field locally on the ground, resulting in conditions favourable for the initiation of an upward streak (called a leader) from a tall object, which can also develop in response to an electric field change created by a nearby preceding lightning flash.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple studies and observations</strong></p>\n<p>According to a paper in Nature on the triggering mechanisms of upward lightning by Carina Schumann and others (July 2019), there have been multiple upward lightning studies that were done in Rapid City, South Dakota, USA and Sao Paulo, Brazil during the summer thunderstorm seasons between 2011 and 2016.</p>\n<p>One of the key objectives of these studies was to characterise the triggering of upward positive leaders from tall objects due to preceding nearby flash activity. As part of this, a total of 110 upward flashes were observed with a combination of high- and standard-speed video and digital still cameras, electric field metres, fast electric-field antenna systems, and also lightning mapping arrays.</p>\n<p>These data sets were analysed, along with correlated lightning location system data, to determine the triggering flash type responsible for the initiation of upward leaders from towers. The paper concluded that the most effective triggering component is “the propagation of the in-cloud negative leader during the continuing current that follows a positive return stroke”.</p>\n<p><strong>Process: Stepped ladder trigger</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Simply put, this process is triggered by the development of the stepped leader (essentially a channel of negative charge that travels downward in a zigzag pattern from a cloud, nearly invisible to the human eye) travelling to the ground in a millisecond, leading to an intensification of the positive charge on the ground.</p>\n<p>As the streaks of the stepped leader keep streaking towards the ground, the electrical charges between the leader tips and the tops of tall objects on the ground keep on increasing. In the due course, these forces cause the air above these tall buildings or towers to ionise and thereby turn more conductive.</p>\n<p>With the negative charge repeatedly moving toward the ground, the channel of air just above the tall objects turns positively charged, which starts streaking upwards and is called an upward streamer. In due course, the negatively-charged, downward-moving stepped leader makes contact with one of the developing positively-charged upwards streamers.</p><div>Also Read</div><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>According to the US Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), when contact is eventually made, the lightning channel is complete and charges can flow rapidly from the cloud toward the ground, and it takes just a fraction of a second to go from the stepped leader initiation to the final connection being made with an upwards streamer.</p>\n</div> ",

As top policymakers and CEOs met in Davos, there was a sense that the global economy might be able to dodge the <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/has-the-world-dodged-recession-reasons-for-hope-caution-8406810/\">chances of a recession in 2023</a></strong>. The <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/imf-world-global-economy-outlook-india-key-takeaways-8414682/\">IMF’s World Economic Outlook</a></strong> in January provided a salutary stamp to that notion. However, the recent <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/credit-suisse-ubs-bank-collapse-us-fed-8507215/\">collapses in the banking sector</a></strong> had yet again ratcheted up the apprehensions of a <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/united-states-federal-reserve-rate-hike-inflation-recession-india-impact-explained-8055978/\">recession</a>.</p><p>In this context, a new research publication by the World Bank, titled “Falling Long-Term Growth Prospects”, argues that the current decade (2020-2030) “could be a lost decade in the making—not just for some countries or regions as has occurred in the past—but for the whole world.”</p><div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"4.927601809954751\" morss_score=\"62.16673224473736\">\n<p>Simply put, the World Bank has found that the overlapping crises of the past few years — <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/\">Covid-19</a> pandemic, Russia’s invasion of <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/russia-invasion-ukraine-history-creation-explained-7791147/\">Ukraine</a> and the resultant spike in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-are-wholesale-price-index-consumer-price-index-inflation-rates-7820831/\">inflation</a> as well as monetary tightening — have ended a span of nearly three decades of sustained economic growth.</p>\n<p>“Starting in 1990, productivity surged, incomes rose, and inflation fell.

It catapulted leaders like <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/mulayam-singh-yadav-profile-8199959/\">Mulayam Singh</a> Yadav, Lalu Prasad, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/elections/nitish-kumar-profile-6721504/\">Nitish Kumar</a>, and Sharad Yadav to national prominence, and sealed the fate of the Congress in UP and Bihar.</p>\n<p>In his 2006 biography of V P Singh, Manzil Se Zyada Safar, Ram Bahadur Rai quoted the former PM as having said: “Congress leaders were obsessed with power equations. They were least concerned with the social equations and changes taking place… It was unable to read the Mandal phenomenon. It took a lot of time to understand the importance of coalition power… The BJP has shown more flexibility than the Congress on (striking alliances).”</p>\n<p>Indeed, the BJP — at that time still considered a largely Brahmin-Bania party — showed the political flexibility to project OBC leaders such as Kalyan Singh, a Lodh Rajput, in UP, to counter Mulayam. As Mulayam’s support base outside the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/samajwadi-party/\">Samajwadi Party</a>’s Yadav-Muslim core started to fragment, Kalyan rallied smaller OBC communities behind the BJP, eventually forging a non-Yadav OBC vote bank. After OBC leaders like Kalyan and Uma Bharti became rebels within the party, the BJP revamped its leadership at every level to accommodate these communities politically.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Kalyan’s successor Ram Prakash Gupta (Nov 1999-Oct 2000) granted Jats OBC status in UP. In a bid to weaken both Mulayam and BSP chief Mayawati, the government of Chief Minister Rajnath Singh (Oct 2000-Mar 2002) devised a “reservation within reservation” to divide OBCs and Dalits.</p>\n<p><strong>UPA govt and later</strong></p>\n<p>In 2006, Arjun Singh, the Union Human Resource Development Minister in the UPA-1 government, fought back pressures to push through 27 per cent reservation for OBCs in admissions to central educational institutions, which had been pending since the implementation of the Mandal report. It was one of the biggest decisions in favour of OBCs, and a defining moment in OBC politics — but hardly any gains accrued to the Congress.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In 2010, the UPA-2 government initiated a move for a caste census. Then Law Minister Veerappa Moily wrote to Prime Minister <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/manmohan-singh/\">Manmohan Singh</a> about collecting caste/ community data in Census 2011.

Because they are incapable of doing so, they are putting it on doctors. We are ready to support the government but we cannot shoulder the entire responsibility. The government spends around Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000 to run each bed in their hospitals. Who will provide us with this money? The Act does not say who will pay these expenses. We urge the government to take back this draconian Bill.”</p>\n<p>The Act does mention that the government will reimburse the hospitals, but the protesters say there is no clarity on how or when these funds will come.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Opinion</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rajasthans-right-to-health-bill-hurts-the-private-health-services-8521901/\">Rajasthan’s Right to Health Bill hurts the private health service</a></div>\n<p>Others claimed the redressal mechanisms mentioned in the Bill will not let doctors work in peace.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is still some confusion among a section of doctors, who are citing the old Bill that was sent to the Select Committee.</p>\n<p>Dr Amit Yadav, former president of Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors, said: “There are several problems with the Bill. One, when they say hospitals have to provide emergency service, they have not defined what an emergency is. It could range from a heart attack to a delivery to a child coming in with stomach ache in the middle of the night. It will increase bureaucratic challenges in hospitals — determining what is and is not an emergency. Second, it does not define a clear mechanism of reimbursement from the government. And third, it does not say who should treat what. If I run an eye clinic, I cannot treat a heart attack case.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The Bill, as finally passed in the Assembly, defines emergency in detail, along with adding “… and any other emergency decided by the State Health Authority”. The government has said that more clarification will be provided when the rules for the Bill are framed.</p>\n<p>About the redressal mechanism, Yadav said local politicians and government-nominated members would be a part of the district authority to look into patients’ complaints. “If I have a tiff with someone, they can lodge a complaint to impede our functioning. It will just become another machine of corruption. There should be a single state-level redressal authority which also has doctors as their members. How can a politician or an IAS officer take a call on medical procedures?”</p>\n<p>The government says this too has been addressed by replacing two nominated members of the government with two IMA members in the State Health Authorities, and the District Health Authorities.</p>\n<p><strong>What do public health experts say?</strong></p>\n<p>Even as doctors continue their protest, many who have been working to increase access to health services have said that the Bill is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Abhay Shukla, national co-convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and one of the people involved in the initial stages of drafting the Bill, said the demand to roll back the Bill because of the clause on emergency treatment is akin to throwing out the baby with the bath water.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“If you read the Bill, 95% of it talks about making the government healthcare systems accountable. Just like MGNREGA made work a right, when health becomes a right, people will be empowered to demand it from the government. This will draw the government’s focus on the gaps in the system,” said Shukla.</p>\n<p>He added, “The section on all hospitals being asked to provide emergency care accounts for only 5% of the Bill. Private hospitals too have some responsibility towards people — doctors’ education has been subsidised by taxpayers, sometimes the land for hospitals is subsidised by the government, there are many other subsidies for them. And the government is not saying that they have to treat anyone for free, the mechanisms for reimbursements are likely to be elaborated in the rules.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>He added it was wrong to say that the Bill suggests an eye hospital would be forced to treat a heart attack or accident case, as hospitals will only have to provide “appropriate level of care” as per the Bill. “And no family member will take one suffering a heart attack to an eye hospital!” he added.</p>\n<p>Advocate Ashok Agarwal, who has been fighting cases to ensure access to healthcare in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a> — and is a part of the committee monitoring that private hospitals honour their commitments in land agreements to treat poor patients for free — said, “There is a 1996 Supreme Court judgement that makes it mandatory for all medical practitioners to provide emergency care, without worrying about payments. It should already have been happening. So why are the doctors protesting?”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>He added that the Bill will also ensure that those who aren’t able to get healthcare— such as people with rare diseases for which treatments are extremely costly — become the responsibility of the state. “The state then cannot deny them treatment because it will be their right.” He said the Bill was a great step, something no state or central government has been able to do so far.</p>\n<p><strong>What are some alternatives?</strong></p>\n<p>Delhi has a scheme under which all hospitals are reimbursed for emergency treatment they provide for road traffic accidents, fires, and acid attacks within the territory of Delhi. Shaleen Mitra, who has worked with the Delhi government’s health department, said, “Since there is already a Supreme Court judgement that says hospitals have to provide emergency care, all we did to implement it was to ensure that hospitals get reimbursements.”</p>\n<p>He said all stakeholders were brought on board and their issues resolved. The rates were determined — lower at first and then at par with Ayushman Bharat, with added incentives for hospitals accredited with National Accreditation Board for Hospitals &amp; Healthcare Providers — and hospitals asked to not charge the patients anything.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>“When a model for providing emergency care already existed in Delhi, a rashly written Bill does not help anyone. It will not help citizens because it will be stuck in litigation, and will also alienate doctors,” said Mitra.</p>\n</div> ",

This is because many such animals are not in need of rescuing. For example, wild cats leave their cubs to go hunting only to find them missing (rescued) on return. Also, many rescuers may not be equipped to either help the animals or ensure they do not become a threat to public health.</p>\n<div><span>Explained Books |</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-books-species-conservation-ecologists-reflect-8328980/\">Conservation of species: Ecologists reflect</a></div>\n<p>In 2019, for example, a singer made headlines for keeping a sun bear in her Kuala Lumpur condominium. She claimed to have found the animal in a weakened state and decided to nurse it back to health. A Malaysian court tried her under the country’s wildlife laws. More recently in 2021, a woman was charged for rescuing wildlife without a permit in Michigan, USA. The Department of Natural Resources arrested her after euthanising six of her animals, including a two-week-old deer.</p>\n<h2><strong>What about India?</strong></h2>\n<p>Under Section 39 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, no person is allowed to acquire or keep in his possession, custody or control any wildlife which is state property. If anyone does so — for example, to treat an injured bird as in the present case — she must report it to the nearest police station or the authorised officer within forty-eight hours of obtaining such possession. Further, under Section 57 of the Act, if a person is found in possession, custody or control of any wildlife, the burden of proof for establishing that the possession, custody or control is not illegal is on the person.</p>\n<div><span>Also read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-antigone-in-up-tale-of-sarus-crane-and-her-human-friend-underlines-the-unavoidable-tragedy-inherent-in-some-friendships-8517544/\">Express View | Antigone in UP: Tale of sarus crane and her human friend underlines the unavoidable tragedy inherent in some friendships</a></div>\n<p>Clearly, WLPA does not allow anyone to take home an injured wild bird and keep it for months without written permission from the state’s chief wildlife warden. But it gets a little complicated when the bird in question is a Sarus crane and the caregiver is a farmer in Uttar Pradesh.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is special about the Sarus?</strong></h2>\n<p>Back in 1861, British ornithologist LH Irby wrote about Sarus cranes he observed in Oudh: “The young birds are easily reared by hand, and become very tame and attached to the person who feeds them, following him like a dog.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The behaviour was explained after 75 years when Austrian zoologist Lorenz Konrad described how young precocial birds (those born with all their feather and able to see and move around immediately) learn to follow real or foster parents. Called imprinting, the process starts with hatching so that the chics follow the appropriate adult for safety.</p>\n<p>KS Gopi Sundar, editor-in-chief of the Waterbirds Society, and the co-chair of the IUCN Stork, Ibis and Spoonbill Specialist Group, who has worked on Sarus cranes since 1998, observed that the window for imprinting could remain open until a Sarus crane pairs with another.</p>\n<p>“In all probability, the bird in question was a young unpaired one from a flock of non-breeding Sarus cranes and that is why it bonded readily during treatment,” he said, adding that the species is anyway well accustomed to farmers and has been thriving in good numbers since the Green revolution.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2><strong>What is farmers’ attitude to the Sarus?</strong></h2>\n<p>Unlike in South-East Asia, Indian farmers have traditionally tolerated the species in their fields. So much so that the species adjusted its breeding behaviour after human activities. For example, unlike elsewhere in its global range, Sarus cranes in India do not wait for the onset of monsoon to start breeding but take the cue from farmers flooding their fields in anticipation of rain.</p>\n<p>Barring some small farmers who resent the omnivorous bird for damaging their crops, the larger community has accepted the species for its deep cultural associations. As the story goes, sage Valmiki cursed a hunter for killing the male of a pair of courting Sarus cranes and the words took the form of a perfect verse, inspiring him to compose the epic.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/modi-surname-gujarat-explained-8522659/\">What’s in a surname: The origins of ‘Modi’, its caste links</a></div>\n<p>At the same time, the farming community also appreciates the material benefits of having Sarus cranes in their fields. The bird, particularly chicks, are voracious eaters of mice and other pests. In the night, their shrill calls alert farmers to crop-raiding nilgais and, increasingly, feral cattle.</p>\n<h2><strong>And what next?</strong></h2>\n<p>Given the biological inclination of the species to bond easily, individual Sarus cranes have moved with people on many occasions. For example, back in 1989, eminent photographer Raghu Rai famously documented how a Sarus crane, onomatopoeically named Kurrkutt, lived with a family in Khajuraho, feeding on chapatis.</p>\n<p>The species is neither a novelty nor under threat in the Northern Indian landscape. Therefore, following the letter of the wildlife law blindly may set damaging precedence.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“In many zoos around the world, cranes have bonded with caretakers. Once that happens, the bird is usually not ‘fit’ for release in the wild because the chances of it bonding with another crane reduce substantially,” said Gopi Sundar.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>Once treated by Arif, the Sarus crane had no future in the wild. But a happy bird does not belong to a zoo or its caregiver in jail. The wisest recourse, therefore, is to reunite the two, and let them be.</p>\n</div> ",

However, its caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati Thursday said this year, the clocks would be reset on April 21.</p>\n<p>While no reason was given, according to AP, a leaked video shows Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri urging Mikati to postpone <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-daylight-saving-time-which-us-senate-voted-scrap-7822839/\">DST</a> to allow Muslims to break their Ramzan fast an hour earlier. The confusion was created as some institutions, including Christian churches, reset their clocks despite Mikati’s decision. Thus, airlines, cellphone operators, schools, workplaces, etc., are no longer following the same time.</p>\n<h2>What happened in Greenland?</h2>\n<p>Greenland reset its clocks this weekend, but will leave them undisturbed when <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-daylight-saving-time-which-us-senate-voted-scrap-7822839/\">daylight saving time</a> ends in autumn. According to AP, officials of Greenland — a Danish semi-independent territory in the Arctic — said another hour of daylight in the afternoons would give them more time to do business with Europe and farther afield.</p>\n<h2>Why was this practice adopted?</h2>\n<p>According to Time and Date, on July 1, 1908, “the residents of Port Arthur, Ontario—today’s Thunder Bay—turned their clocks forward by one hour to start the world’s first DST period. Other locations in Canada soon followed suit.” The idea caught on globally after Germany and Austria introduced DST on April 30, 1916, to minimise the use of artificial lighting and save fuel during World War I.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>Today, many argue that with most appliances consuming energy running at all hours of the day, DST has lost relevance. Some studies have also shown that disruption of the body clock due to the DST has adverse health effects.</p>\n</div> ",

          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"4.725099601593625\" morss_score=\"64.08509960159363\">\n<p><strong>What is the dispute?</strong></p>\n<p>The Dawoodi Bohras are a religious denomination among Shia Muslims. Traditionally a community of traders and entrepreneurs, it has over 5 lakh members in India and over 10 lakh members across the world. The top religious leader of the community is known as the Dai-al-Mutlaq.</p><p>In 2014, the 52nd Dai-al-Mutlaq, Syedna Mohammad Burhanuddin, passed away, and his son, Mufaddal Saifuddin, succeeded him. This was challenged by the late Syedna’s half-brother, Khuzaima Qutbuddin, in the Bombay HC. Justice Gautam S Patel has been hearing the suit for its final disposal since November last year.</p>\n<p><strong>How is the leader picked?</strong></p>\n<p>As per faith and Dawoodi Bohra doctrine, a successor is appointed through “divine inspiration”. A “nass” (conferment of succession) can be conferred upon any deserving member of the community and not necessarily a family member of the current Dai, although the latter is often the practice.</p>\n<p><strong>What are Syedna Qutbuddin’s claims?</strong></p>\n<p>Qutbuddin had in April 2014 filed a suit asking the High Court to restrain the late Syedna’s son from acting as the Dai-al-Mutlaq. He also sought entry to Saifi Manzil, the house of the Syedna in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/\">Mumbai</a>, alleging that Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin had taken over the leadership role in a “fraudulent manner”.</p>\n<p>Qutbuddin claimed that after Burhanuddin became the new Dai-al-Mutlaq, taking over from his father Syedna Taher Saifuddin in 1965, he had publicly appointed his half brother as the mazoon (second in command) and privately anointed him as his successor through a secret nass, prior to the mazoon announcement on December 10, 1965.</p>\n<p>Syedna Qutbuddin stated that in the public appointment, the persons of “higher spiritual learning present” understood that along with the title of maazoon, he was also given the title of mansoos (successor), though the latter was not conveyed in as many words. Burhanuddin asked him to keep the private nass a secret, Qutbuddin claimed. He maintained that he had abided by the oath of secrecy given to him by the 52nd Dai till his death.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Senior advocate Anand Desai argued that as the Dai is “infallible” and as the Dai appoints a successor based on “divine inspiration of the Imam in seclusion”, the ‘nass’ or appointment of successor cannot be changed and revoked.</p>\n<p>Qutbuddin died in 2016 in the USA. Since then, his son, Syedna Taher Fakhruddin is the plaintiff and is now seeking declaration as the leader by the High Court. Fakhruddin has claimed his father conferred the nass upon him and thus he should be declared the Dai.</p>\n<p><strong>What has Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin claimed?</strong></p>\n<p>Defendant Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin made submissions through senior advocates Iqbal Chagla, Janak Dwarkadas and Fredun Devitre.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The lawyers argued that the nass of 1965 lacked witnesses and could not be accepted. They argued that as per established and prevalent doctrines of the Dawoodi Bohra faith, nass could be changed and revoked.</p>\n<p>The senior advocates told the bench that on June 4, 2011, the 52nd Dai had conferred nass on Syedna Saifuddin in the presence of witnesses at the Bupa Cromwell hospital in London, where he was admitted after suffering a stroke.</p>\n<p>Thirteen witnesses deposed on behalf of the defendant, which included the doctors who treated the 52nd Dai, son and grandson of the deceased Dai, and others with expertise in the Dawoodi Bohra doctrine, along with the rector of the community library.</p>\n<p>The witnesses presented documents to show that the 52nd Dai, in the year 1969, had made his intention of appointing his son (defendant) as his successor and had informed close and senior members of the community about the same and the conferment was reiterated in 2005 in secret and reaffirmed publicly in June 2011.</p>\n<p>The senior lawyers representing the defendant questioned the silence maintained by Syedna Qutbuddin about his claim to the post of Dai between 2011 and 2014, and said he only made the claim after the Dai’s demise as an “afterthought.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The defendant also contended that even if nass had been conferred on the original plaintiff in 1965, as per the doctrinal belief of the community, only the last nass would be valid.</p>\n</div> ",

Initially, he sought $3 million but then dropped the amount to $300,000.</p>\n<p>The incident took place on February 26, 2016, when, according to Sanderson, the actor allegedly crashed into him while they were skiing on a beginner’s slope at the Deer Valley Resort in Utah’s Park City.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff has claimed that Paltrow was skiing behind him and the collision happened as the “celebrity had turned to watch her children ski and “as she turns her head back down, she screams, then skis into the back of Terry Sanderson”,” The Washington Post reported.</p>\n<p>The accident allegedly left Sanderson “facedown in the snow, unconscious”, one of his lawyers Lawrence Buhler said in court on March 21. He further added that after the crash, the actor didn’t stop to check on Sanderson and fled the spot. Later, when the plaintiff went to the hospital, the doctors told him that he had sustained a concussion and four broken ribs.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Buhler also alleged that as a result of the collision, Sanderson suffered a “permanent traumatic brain injury”, which caused him emotional damage. ““Before this crash, Terry was an outgoing, charming, gregarious person,” the lawyer said. “But after the crash, he’s no longer charming.”</p>\n<p>There is only one witness in the case, Craig Ramon, an acquaintance and ski companion of Sanderson’s, who said in his testimony that he heard a scream before he saw Paltrow crash into the retired optometrist.</p>\n<p><strong>What has Paltrow said?</strong></p>\n<p>In her testimony on March 24, the actor said that although the collision did take place, Sanderson was responsible for it and not her. She added that the incident left her “hurt and violated”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“I was skiing and two skis came between my skis, forcing my legs apart and then there was a body pressing against me and there was a very strange grunting noise,” Paltrow said. “My brain was trying to make sense of what was happening. I thought, ‘Is this a practical joke? Is someone doing something perverted? This is really, really strange.”</p>\n<p>Once the actor and Sanderson collided, according to Paltrow, they both toppled to the ground. “I remember pushing away because I was very upset,” the CEO mentioned in her testimony. “I pushed down the hill and I turned around and yelled at him … I said, ‘You skied directly into my […] back,’ and he said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry,’” The Washington Post reported.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/honduras-snaps-ties-taiwan-ally-china-countries-recognise-taiwan-one-china-policy-8521190/\">Honduras snaps ties with Taiwan in favour of China: Which countries recognise Taiwan currently?</a></div>\n<p>Meanwhile, Paltrow’s lawyer, Stephen Owens, has claimed that after the incident, people who had accompanied the actor to the skiing trip did check on Sanderson, who said he was okay. Not only this, Owens has also alleged that initially the plaintiff or anyone else didn’t recognise the actor. However, once her identity was revealed a day later, “Sanderson wrote to his daughters, “I’m famous.” One of them responded, “I’m so glad you’re okay.,”” the news outlet said.</p>\n<p>The Goop CEO has filed a counter lawsuit against Sanderson, seeking a symbolic $1 in damages and lawyer fees.

Of the 35 accused, only four, including Faizal and his brother, were convicted.</p>\n<p>The UT of Lakshadweep had opposed the suspension of the sentence of the convicts, saying that granting them the relief would “shake the people’s faith in the judicial process.” It also said the offense committed by Faizal and his brother, who was a teacher in a government school, had shocked the society of the island archipelago where few crimes are reported.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/rahul-gandhi-perks-and-benefits-8518345/\">Rahul Gandhi disqualified as MP: Here are the perks and benefits he is set to lose</a></div>\n<p>Consequently, the UT approached the Apex Court through SG Tushar Mehta, challenging the decision of the Kerala High Court.

While sections of Israel’s population have been protesting against the proposed laws for months, on Monday, there were reports that far right crowds were marching towards the protesters, raising concerns about a clash.</p>\n<p>Netanyahu was expected to make a televised statement Monday announcing that the judicial overhaul plans had been suspended. While he is yet to comment on that, the PM appealed for peace on Twitter. “I call on all the demonstrators in Jerusalem, on the right and the left, to behave responsibly and not to act violently. We are brotherly people,” Netanhayu tweeted.</p>\n<p><strong>Escalation of the protests</strong></p>\n<p>Departing flights from the country’s main international airport were grounded, large mall chains and universities shut their doors, and Israel’s largest trade union group called for its 800,000 members — in health, transit, banking and other fields — to stop work. The spokesman for Israel’s largest trade union said diplomats at Israeli missions abroad are also striking against the government’s plan to overhaul the judiciary. Yaniv Levy, the Histadrut spokesman, said the missions were providing only emergency services.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Apart from the contested judicial overhaul plans, others factors have contributed to the turmoil in Israel. <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/turmoil-in-israel-8478880/\">Read our explainer on that here</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>The growing resistance to Netanyahu’s plan came hours after tens of thousands of people burst into the streets against the prime minister’s decision to fire his defence minister after he called for a pause to the juducial overhaul. Chanting “the country is on fire,” they lit bonfires on Tel Aviv’s main highway, closing the thoroughfare and many others throughout the country for hours. Thousands of protesters gathered Monday outside the Knesset, or parliament, to keep up the pressure.</p>\n<p><strong>Crowds outside Netanhayu’s home</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Netanyahu on Sunday <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/israel-netanyahu-sacks-defence-minister-sparks-mass-protests-8520747/\">sacked Defence Minister Yoav Gallant</a></strong>, a day after Gallant broke ranks with the government and urged a halt to a highly contested plan to overhaul the judicial system.</p>\n\n<p>As news of the dismissal spread, tens of thousands of protesters, many waving blue and white Israeli flags, took to the streets late at night across the country. Crowds gathered outside Netanyahu’s home in Jerusalem, at one point breaching a security cordon.</p>\n<p>Gallant had warned on Saturday that the overhaul plans risked “a clear, immediate and tangible threat to the security of the state” and called for them to be halted. “At this time, for the sake of our country, I am willing to take any risk and pay any price,” the former navy admiral said in his televised address.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Israel’s consul-general in New York said he was resigning over the dismissal. Israel’s research universities announced they would stop holding classes due to the legislative push, calling for its immediate freeze.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background of the planned judicial overhaul</strong></p>\n<p>Netanyahu returned as Prime Minister on December 29 last year at the head of what is seen as the most right-wing government in Israel’s history. His Likud has 32 seats in the 120-member Knesset, ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties have 18, and an extreme-right alliance has 14 seats.</p>\n<p>Even before the new government was formed, as a quid pro quo by Likud to keep its allies, the Knesset passed a law enabling anyone convicted of an offence but not sentenced to prison to serve as a minister. This helped a member of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Shas Party convicted of tax offences with a suspended sentence to take charge of three ministries.</p>\n<p>Another law enabled two ministers in one office. Thus the leader of the Religious Zionism party who is the finance minister, came to hold charge of the defence ministry that controls civil affairs in the West Bank. Parties to the coalition agreed on proposals for for the overhaul of the country’s judicial system.</p>\n<p><strong>What exactly do the planned laws propose?</strong></p>\n<p>The Israeli judiciary has a reputation for fierce independence, and the draft laws to shackle it include a Bill to change the composition of the nine-member committee that selects judges. This panel currently has the minister of justice and another minister, the Supreme Court president and two judges, two Knesset members, and two representatives of the bar. Under the new proposal, government-nominated members would be in a 7-4 majority in an expanded committee.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/israelis-protest-judicial-overhaul-what-changes-8387793/\">government also wants to enable the 120-member parliament</a></strong>, or Knesset, to override any Supreme Court judgement by a simple majority of 61 votes unless those rulings are unanimous.</p>\n<p>Third, it also seeks to scrap the test of “reasonability” which the apex court has previously used to strike out executive practices.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Lastly, the government wants to allow ministers to choose their own legal advisors instead of using independent professionals.</p>\n<p><em><strong>with inputs from AP, Reuters </strong></em></p>\n</div> ",

We look at the process of changing the visa status from H1-B to B1/B2 while in the US.</p><h2>What is the H1-B visa?</h2>\n<p>The H-1B is a temporary (non-immigrant) visa category that allows employers to petition for highly educated foreign professionals to work in “specialty occupations” that require at least a bachelor’s degree. Jobs in fields such as mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical sciences often qualify for this visa type.

The current annual statutory cap is 65,000 visas, with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from the US.</p>\n<h2>What is B1/B2 visa?</h2>\n<p>Visitor visas are non-immigrant visas for those who want to enter the US temporarily for business (B-1), for tourism (B-2), or for a combination of both purposes (B-1/B-2). Interviews are generally required for visa applicants with certain exceptions, pertaining to age-group and whether it’s a first-time applicant or a renewal case. B1/B2 allows for multiple entries and is generally issued for a period of 10 years, where a person can stay for up to six months at a time.</p>\n<p>However, an individual on a visitor visa (B1/B2) is not permitted to accept employment or work in the US, even as searching for employment and interviewing for a position are permissible B-1 or B-2 activities.</p>\n<p>Before beginning any new employment, a petition and request for a change of status from B-1 or B-2 to an employment-authorised status must be approved, and the new status must take effect, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) says.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>How to switch from H1-B to B1/B2 and vice-versa</h2>\n<p>In case someone loses a job while on H1-B status but wants to stay on in the US, she can file a change of status to B1/B2 and continue to look for the next H-1b sponsor.

In case someone finds the next sponsor even before the B2 application is approved, she can withdraw the plea.</p>\n<p>However, a B1/B2 visa requires one to furnish ample financial evidence, to show the applicant can self-fund the entire stay in the US, and some proof of ties to your home country.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>On the other hand, if someone has travelled to the US on B1/B2, and wants to convert it into H1-B upon getting a job offer, the person may be able to request a change in the non-immigrant status to another category through USCIS.</p>\n</div> ",

According to reports, the incident took place after Raju defeated Ahmed’s brother, Ashraf, in an Assembly bypoll held in 2005 for the Allahabad West seat. “It was a big loss for the Ahmed family as the seat had fallen vacant after Atiq won the Lok Sabha seat from Allahabad in the 2004 general elections”, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com\">The Indian Express</a> reported.</p>\n<p>On January 25, 2005, Raju was shot dead near his house while he was returning from a hospital along with his associates Sandeep Yadav and Devi Lal. Subsequently, Raju’s wife lodged an FIR against Atiq, Ashraf and seven unidentified people on charges of rioting, attempt to murder, murder and criminal conspiracy.</p>\n<p>Due to political and police pressure, Atiq Ahmed finally surrendered in 2008 only to be released in 2012. He then contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on an SP ticket but lost. Things worsened for him during this time as his relationship with the SP soured as Akhilesh Yadav distanced himself from Ahmed due to his criminal record.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In February 2017, he was arrested by the police for allegedly assaulting staff members of the Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences in Prayagraj.

However, the top German rower is still having to contend with an opponent who is difficult to assess.</p><p>The 24-year-old, younger sister of two-time world champion Oliver Zeidler, contracted <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/\">Covid-19</a> for the second time just over a month ago. At the time her lung capacity was reduced to 60 per cent. Today she has to cope with a loss of just over 25 per cent. “It’s extremely frightening to see how quickly the body can break down, even though you’re actually fit,” Zeidler tells DW.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/marburg-virus-disease-outbreak-tanzania-explained-8519874/\">Marburg virus disease outbreak kills five in Tanzania: What is this virus?</a></div>\n<p>For six months after her first infection in October 2020, she struggled with <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/world-lung-day-2022-improve-lung-function-patients-long-covid-8171225/\"><strong>Long Covid</strong></a> symptoms such as rapid physical exhaustion, shortness of breath and other unpleasantries before she regained her former fitness. “Yes, medicine has now advanced and there are medications,” says Zeidler, who is employed as a police officer.</p>\n<p>The anti-Covid medicine has helped and now everything goes faster, she says. Therefore, the elite rower hopes to be able to find a way back to her old form more quickly and permanently. “But whether there’s enough time to have a realistic chance at the Olympic Games remains to be seen,” says Zeidler, who still has to qualify for the summer spectacle.</p>\n<h2><strong>Long Covid’s treatment is challenging</strong></h2>\n<p>“Even though we as a science community are getting to know this disease more and more – there is not one single way to combat Long Covid. We’re talking about 200 different symptoms that have to be differentiated,” Wilhelm Bloch, head of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Sports Medicine at the German Sport University Cologne, tells DW.</p>\n<p>However, he and his colleagues are getting closer to better approaches and treatment methods. Bloch, however, leaves no doubt about how serious Long Covid is. According to the sports scientist, around six per cent of those affected are no longer able to practice their sport at all: “There are individual cases in the post-Covid area, they are just dramatic.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Physical exhaustion is often observed in Long Covid patients – persistent fatigue, deep lack of strength and lack of drive, so that normal everyday life can hardly be managed. That’s how Marie-Sophie Zeidler had experienced it, too. “You always have to focus on the patient’s individual complaints in each case, that’s very important,” says Bloch. That’s what often makes treatment so challenging and sometimes complicated.</p>\n<h2><strong>From the easy to the difficult</strong></h2>\n<p>At TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen, rehab coach Hans-Peter Gierden works in specially-developed courses to help Long Covid patients gradually get back on their feet. “Many people can’t concentrate, some have balance problems. And there’s always fatigue involved,” Gierden says. “The trick is not to overwhelm the participant and to get the exercises right.”</p>\n<p>Every hour of class is put together differently, he explains. “It may be that I combine balance exercises with strengthening exercises. Or sometimes there’s a badminton lesson. All exercises are always done from light to heavy. And if it gets too much, you can go back to the previous exercise,” Gierden says. After each exercise session, the 57-year-old uses the so-called “Borg scale” (named after the Swedish physiologist Gunnar Borg) to check how the individual course participants felt about the subjective strain.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“Since I’ve been taking part in it, I’ve been feeling much better,” Hermann-Josef Eigen tells DW. In April 2021, a Covid-19 infection had hit the formerly active amateur athlete quite hard, and he was on the verge of being admitted to intensive care. “I could no longer breathe properly. Nothing worked for me,” says the 61-year-old.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/world-tb-day-how-india-plans-to-achieve-its-target-of-eliminating-tb-by-2025-8515410/\">World TB Day 2023: How India plans to achieve its target of eliminating tuberculosis by 2025</a></div>\n<p>It took almost four months before he was even able to take a few steps again. When his health started to improve, he joined Hans-Peter Gierden’s rehabilitation course. “The type of training made the shortness of breath fade into oblivion,” Eigen says. He now practices the exercises at home, outside of classes, for at least an hour every day, he says. “I feel even better now than before I got sick.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Zeidler: ‘Strange disease’</strong></h2>\n<p>“In the months after the illness, athletes usually complain that they can’t get up to full capacity. Especially in the first three months, it is easy to tell how affected athletes are by their elevated resting pulse,” says sports scientist Bloch. “But it often takes a few months more before everything is back to the old performance level.”</p>\n<p>After carefully increasing her workload, rower Marie-Sophie Zeidler is currently symptom-free after most physical exertions. At a recent training camp, she was able to push herself towards her physical limits again. Only after the last day of training did she quite unexpectedly fall into a physical hole. “Suddenly, nothing worked for me again,” said Zeidler, who is about to compete in her first competition after the recent brush with Long Covid.</p>\n<p>“That’s the strange thing about this disease: you just can’t predict the body’s reaction. On a good day anything is possible, on a bad day nothing at all.” For now she’ll just have to accept being surprised.</p>\n</div> ",

Websites can also be fined for “addictive” design features.</p><h2>Why have the measures been introduced?</h2>\n<p>These are aimed at controlling the impact of social media on younger generations. The state government’s website said, “Utah is at the forefront of holding social media companies accountable for the harms they are causing our children and young people.”</p>\n<div><span>Explained </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/us-china-tiktok-ban-data-explained-8515706/\">As US-China tug of war intensifies, why the clock is ticking for TikTok in America</a></div>\n<p>State Governor Spencer Cox said studies have shown time spent on social media leads to “poor mental health outcomes” for children. “We remain very optimistic that we will be able to pass not just here in the state of Utah but across the country legislation that significantly changes the relationship of our children with these very destructive social media apps,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Is Utah unique in doing this?</h2>\n<p>American lawmakers have expressed concern over the explosion in social media use in the past few years. Incidentally, the Utah laws were passed on the same day that TikTok’s CEO was grilled in the US Congress by lawmakers. While that hearing was focused on assessing China’s control over the app, many raised concerns over children’s use of these apps.</p>\n<p>Arkansas, Texas, Ohio and Louisiana and New Jersey are also looking at similar proposals while California enacted a law last year prohibiting tech companies from profiling children or using personal information in ways that could harm children physically or mentally.</p>\n<p>These themes were in US President Joe Biden’s February <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-state-of-the-union-address-us-president-7797230/\">State of the Union address</a>, too. “Let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children…We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit. And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Two years ago, another Utah legislation called on tech companies to automatically block porn on cell phones and tablets sold, citing the dangers posed to children, the AP reported. Although amid concerns about enforcement, lawmakers in the deeply religious state revised it to not take effect unless five other states passed similar laws.</p>\n<h2>What exactly do the new laws say?</h2>\n<p>Starting March 1, 2024, Senate Bill 152 will require social media companies to verify the adult age of a resident who wants to maintain or open an account, get the consent of a parent or guardian for users under age 18 and “allow parents full access to their child’s account”.</p>\n<p>It would create a “default curfew setting that blocks access overnight (10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m.)” which can be adjusted by parents – who could also set a daily time limit for accessing such websites. It prohibits direct messaging by anyone who the child hasn’t followed or friended. It requires companies to block underage accounts from search results, restricts them from collecting a child’s data and says children’s accounts cannot be targeted for advertising.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/instagram-for-kids-app-negative-impact-mental-health-teen-girls-7540844/\">Explained: Why Instagram is under the lens for its ‘negative impact’ on teen girls</a></div>\n<p>Companies can be fined for violations. Another bill outlines penalties for social media companies which target users under the age of 18 with “addictive algorithms”, including a $250,000 fine for “addictive design features” and a penalty of up to $2,500 per child exposed to an addictive feature. The measures allow parents to sue social media companies directly for the “financial, physical, or emotional harms in certain circumstances”, adding that for youth under 16, the harm would be presumed under the law and the companies would have to prove otherwise.</p>\n<h2>How will the enforcement work?</h2>\n<p>That is what is unclear at the moment.</p>\n<p>Age restrictions for registering on apps like Instagram and Twitter already exist, with 13 years being the requirement most often. Companies are prohibited from collecting data on children under 13 without parental consent under the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. But in reality, an incorrect, older date of birth can be entered by underage kids – and it often is – as there is no need for verification.</p>\n<p>In addition to the parental consent provisions, social media companies would likely have to design new features, AP noted, and tech companies earn money by targeting ads to their users. Governor Cox has previously said he believes social media companies will challenge the new measures in court.</p>\n<p>But such changes have been proposed before. In 2019, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/\">Facebook</a> said an ‘Instagram for Kids’ was in the works for those under 13. The rationale was that children are now getting phones in the US at a very young age and that they do end up using such apps by entering incorrect ages, so a for-kids version would be tailored for them for safe use. Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote in a post, “It won’t have ads, and it will have age-appropriate content and features. Parents can supervise the time their children spend on the app and oversee who can message them, who can follow them, and who they can follow.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>However, these plans were halted following reports of studies, particularly one from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, that used Instagram’s internal information to show the ill effects of Instagram on young users’ self-esteem, particularly for girls.</p>\n<p>And while there is a common consensus over the <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/health-fitness/technology-social-media-impacts-kids-mental-health-5678958/\">ill effects of social media</a></strong> on children, a solution of this kind raises further questions. “Children may be put at increased risk if these laws are enforced in such a way that they’re not allowed to some privacy, if they are not allowed some ability for freedom of speech or autonomy,” said Kris Perry, executive director of the nonprofit Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media and Child Development, to the AP.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Social media apps can also help children from vulnerable backgrounds or those in violent homes access help and community, critics of the law have said. Interestingly, Utah is a Republican state and the party is often seen as opposing the idea of regulation in people’s private lives – both by the government in the lives of people, and in the working of businesses. On social media and children, its usual criticisms are no longer being applied.</p>\n<p><em><strong>(With inputs from AP)</strong></em></p>\n</div> ",

Even outside the context of these events, this statement, Alexander Grigoryevich Lukashenko has long been raising the question of the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus.”</p><div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/hindenburg-report-jack-dorsey-block-inc-8517322/\">Hindenburg’s new report: What are the allegations against Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Block Inc?</a></div>\n<p>While Putin didn’t mention how many nuclear weapons Russia would keep in Belarus, the US government believes the Kremlin has around 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, including “bombs that can be carried by tactical aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds,” <em>Associated Press</em> reported.</p>\n<p>The Russian President’s announcement has come after Annabel Goldie, Minister of State for Defence of the United Kingdom, said on March 20 that some of the ammunition for the Challenger 2 battle tanks that Britain is giving to <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/russia-invasion-ukraine-history-creation-explained-7791147/\">Ukraine</a> includes armour-piercing rounds which contain depleted uranium.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is depleted uranium?</strong></h2>\n<p>Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the process of creating enriched uranium, which is used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. In comparison to enriched uranium, depleted uranium is much less radioactive and is incapable of generating a nuclear reaction. However, due to its high density — it’s more dense than lead — depleted uranium is widely used in weapons as it can easily penetrate armour plating.</p>\n<p>Speaking to <em>AP</em>, Edward Geist, RAND nuclear expert and policy researcher, said, “It’s so dense and it’s got so much momentum that it just keeps going through the armour — and it heats it up so much that it catches on fire.”</p>\n<p>The news outlet also mentioned that the US began manufacturing armour-piercing rounds with depleted uranium in the 1970s and has since added it to composite tank armour to strengthen it.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“It also has added depleted uranium to the munitions fired by the Air Force’s A-10 close air support attack plane, known as the tank killer. The US military is still developing depleted uranium munitions, notably the M829A4 armour-piercing round for the M1A2 Abrams main battle tank”, the report added.</p>\n<h2><strong>Which countries have depleted uranium munitions?</strong></h2>\n<p>Apart from the US, Britain, Russia, China, France and Pakistan produce uranium weapons, which are not classified as nuclear weapons, as per the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, <em>Reuters</em> said. Another 14 states are known to store them, it mentions.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the risks of using such weapons?</strong></h2>\n<p>Even though depleted uranium munitions aren’t considered nuclear weapons, experts suggest that such weapons must be used with caution because they emit low levels of radiation and can cause severe diseases.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“Ingesting or inhaling quantities of uranium – even depleted uranium – is dangerous: it depresses renal function and raises the risk of developing a range of cancers.,” <em>Reuters</em> said. Moreover, according to the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons, depleted uranium munitions which miss their target can poison groundwater and soil.</p>\n<h2><strong>Where have depleted uranium munitions been used?</strong></h2>\n<p>Depleted uranium munitions were used in the 1991 Gulf War to destroy T-72 tanks in Iraq. These weapons were again used in the 1999 <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-nato-why-is-russia-so-insecure-about-ukraine-joining-us-led-alliance-7805037/\">NATO</a> bombing of Yugoslavia and then during the 2003 <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/20-years-iraq-usa-invasion-iraq-reasons-impact-8506646/\"><strong>invasion of Iraq.</strong></a></p>\n<p>According to the Royal Society, a London-based fellowship of scientists, “About 340 tons of depleted uranium were used in munitions during the 1991 Gulf War, and an estimated 11 tons in the Balkans in the late 1990s,” <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>\n</div> ",

The U.S. government notification did not specify when the revised ruling would come into force, saying it would happen when each side tells the other it has completed the necessary domestic procedures.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/migrants-boats-heated-issue-united-kingdom-immigration-explained-8486537/\">Why are migrants in small boats a heated issue in the UK?</a></div>\n<p>In addition, Canada will open 15,000 slots for migrants from the Western Hemisphere to apply to enter the country legally as part of the agreement, the U.S. official said. A Canadian government official said these would be resettled refugees.</p>\n<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss the issue during a meeting in Ottawa on Friday. The announcement will likely come afterwards although some details are being worked out. Trudeau has been under political pressure as irregular crossings into Canada have spiked and said in February that he would raise the issue during the Biden visit.</p>\n<h2>What is the Canada-US Safe Third world Country Agreement?</h2>\n<p>The existing STCA was signed in 2002 and took effect in 2004. Under the agreement, asylum seekers trying to cross from the U.S. into Canada or vice versa at formal border crossings are turned back and told to apply for asylum in the first “safe” country they arrived in.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Asylum seekers have been crossing at Roxham Road, a path linking New York state to the province of Quebec, because the STCA does not apply at such spots, only at formal border crossings. Once people cross, Royal Canadian Mounted Police apprehend them but they are allowed to file and pursue refugee claims in Canada.</p>\n<h2>What has been happening at Roxham road?</h2>\n<p>Growing numbers of asylum seekers have been crossing: 40,000 last year and 5,000 in January alone. Quebec’s premier and opposition politicians have called for Roxham Road to be “closed.” In response to Quebec leaders saying the province cannot support more migrants, Canada’s government has been transporting them to other provinces.</p>\n<h2>Why does Canada need to negotiate with the US?</h2>\n<p>Canada has been saying it wants to renegotiate the STCA so it applies across the length of the border, not just at formal crossings. This would allow Canadian officials to turn back asylum seekers trying to cross at Roxham Road or anywhere else.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What would it mean to expand the STCA?</h2>\n<p>The broader effects of expanding the Canada-U.S. asylum bar across the entire 6,416 km (3,987-mile) land border are unclear. Migrant crossings at Roxham Road may decrease in the short term but refugee advocates say people hoping to evade detection might take riskier routes.</p>\n<h2>What would the reported deal mean for the US?</h2>\n<p>The number of migrants crossing illegally from Canada into the U.S. also has risen sharply in recent months. U.S. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 2,900 people crossing illegally from Canada since October, more than all of fiscal year 2022. About half of those were Mexicans, who do not need a visa to travel to Canada.</p>\n</div> ",

Out of that 75%, around 70% would be in rural areas, which he defines as “any place outside (say 10 km from) a district headquarters”.</p>\n<div><span>Explained </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/wheat-output-and-inflation-8492909/\">How will India’s wheat output affect food inflation in 2023?</a></div>\n<p>In other words, the market for two-wheelers is predominantly in the hinterland. There are four key drivers of rural demand.</p>\n<p>The first is the virtual absence of mass public transport in villages or even mofussil and semi-urban pockets. The second is the building of all-weather roads over the last two decades — especially under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana — that has helped spur ownership of personal vehicles beyond bullock carts and bicycles. The third is increased incomes. The fourth is the availability of finance for the purchase of a vehicle.</p>\n<h2>Going into negative</h2>\n<p>Against this background, there have been concerns over falling two-wheeler sales — from the all-time-high 21.2 million of 2018-19 to a 10-year-low of 13.5 million in 2021-22 (which the Finance Ministry’s latest <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/economic-survey-2023-significance-explained-8414187/\">Economic Survey</a> also flagged). While sales may recover to 15.9 million in the fiscal ending March 31, 2023, that will still be just about the level of 2014-15 (see table).</p>\n<span><img src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/Domestic-sales-tractors-and-two-wheelers-chart.png?resize=600,559\"> Chart on domestic two-wheeler and tractor sales. (Source: Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers &amp; Tractor and Mechanization Association)</span>\n<p>To what extent is the decline in sales a reflection of rural incomes being under stress?</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>This is apparently reinforced by other indicators too, such as the sales of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). The analytics firm NielsenIQ’s FMCG Snapshot for October-December 2022 shows volume growth (the number of units bought, as opposed to the value of purchases) over the same quarter of 2021 at 1.6% in urban India and minus 2.8% in rural India.</p>\n<p>The rural market has, therefore, seemingly contracted both for FMCG and two-wheelers. In the latter case, this could be due to stress on incomes (entry-level models have registered the highest de-growth) as well as the fourth driver (drying up of credit, particularly from non-banking financial companies following the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd in September 2018).</p>\n<h2>Tractors defy trend</h2>\n<p>The table, however, reveals an opposite trend when it comes to tractors.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Sales of tractors, unlike two-wheelers, actually fell during the first three years of the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> government from 2014-15 to 2016-17. This was largely due to two consecutive bad monsoon years (2014 and 2015), a crash in global agri-commodity prices after 2014, and low increases in the government’s minimum support prices (<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/farmers-crops-price-msp-explained-7789563/\">MSP</a>). The MSP of wheat, for instance, rose by an average of only Rs 75 per quintal per year between 2013-14 and 2016-17, and by Rs 53/quintal for paddy.</p>\n<p>But in the subsequent period, tractor sales again, in contrast to two-wheelers, zoomed, peaking at 8.99 lakh units in the pandemic-lockdowns year of 2020-21. Hemant Sikka, president (farm equipment sector) of India’s largest tractor manufacturer Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd, expects sales to cross 9.3 lakh in 2022-23. “This will be our best year with a 10% growth over 2021-22,” he said.</p>\n<h2>Drivers of sales</h2>\n<p>Sikka attributed the buoyant sales primarily to four good monsoons in a row from 2019 to 2022: “God has been very kind.” The record agricultural output during these years has been accompanied by prices, too, holding up well. The average annual MSP hike from 2016-17 to 2022-23 was also higher, at Rs 83/quintal in wheat and Rs 95/quintal for paddy. Overall, it has translated into increased farm incomes.</p>\n<p>In the two pandemic years of 2020-21 and 2021-22, farmers had few avenues for discretionary expenditure. Some of the monies not spent on marriages and other social functions likely went towards the purchase of tractors.</p>\n<p>“Buying a tractor is like getting an earning member in the family. The tractor does not sit idle. When not working on one’s own farm, it is rented out to other farmers or used for transporting crops, bricks, and even people for up to 50-100 km. And tractors don’t need to be <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-fed-and-what-role-does-it-play-us-economy-7824639/\">fed</a> and bathed daily like bullocks that cannot also be left alone at home,” Sikka noted.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>He estimated the non-farm use of tractors — the time that they aren’t working the fields and, instead, hauling sand, construction material or people — at 35-40%.</p>\n<p>Sikka ascribed the industry’s good run also to supportive policies. The government had originally planned to introduce new Bharat Stage TREM IV emission standards for tractors with above 50 horsepower engines from October 1, 2020. That would have entailed replacing mechanical pumps for fuel injection with <strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3JXb2mR\">semiconductor-based common rail direct injection (CRDI) engines.</a></strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>But following representations from tractor makers, the implementation of the revised emission norms was deferred and made effective from January 1, 2023. Companies were also given six months’ additional time to sell their existing stock of tractors based on TREM III A standards.</p>\n<p>“The Ministries of Agriculture and Road Transport &amp; Highways were both helpful. They didn’t insist on immediate implementation of the TREM IV norms, keeping in view the unprecedented global shortage of semiconductor chips as well as our national food security concerns,” Sikka said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Agri versus non-agri</h2>\n<p>All of this still begs the question: What explains the divergence between robust tractors and dwindling two-wheeler sales?</p>\n<p>One reason is that tractors are a relatively niche product, with their buyers mostly restricted to farmers, as against the ubiquitous and mass-consumed two-wheelers. Even if tractor sales cross a million, it would be a fraction of the 20-million-plus scaled by two-wheelers in 2017-18 and 2018-19. Also, a basic 35-40 horsepower tractor costs upwards of Rs 5.5 lakh on the road today, almost 10 times the price of an entry-level motorbike.</p>\n<p>Another explanation — from Tanvee Gupta Jain, chief economist at UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd — may have to do with the non-agriculture segment of the rural economy not faring too well. While agriculture is all rural, rural isn’t entirely agriculture. One indicator of this is rural wages (see chart). “The pick-up in wages for agriculture has been better than for non-agriculture,” Jain said.</p>\n<span><img src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/Chart.png?resize=600,368\"> Chart on rural wage growth from September 2020 to November 2022. (Source: Labour Bureau and UBS Research)</span>\n<p>And that could probably also account for tractor sales not being the best gauge of the overall health of Bharat now.</p>\n</div> ",

However, these were not two years of inaction. During his time in prison, he led a massive hunger strike, demanding better conditions for his fellow inmates, all while reading and writing vociferously. In fact, much of what is known about his ideas come from what he wrote during his time in prison.</p><p>One of the most poignant pieces of writing by Singh is his essay titled ‘Why I am an Atheist’. This was originally penned down in October 1930, around the time he was sentenced to death, while Singh was an inmate at the Lahore Central Jail. It was a reply to his more religious friends who felt that he became an atheist out of sheer vanity.</p>\n<div><span>In Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/upsc-essentials-dr-br-ambedkar-this-quote-means-explained-8318419/\">Said by Dr BR Ambedkar, This Quote Means: ‘Fraternity is only another name for democracy’</a></div>\n<p>Here, we take a look at an excerpt from this essay. Notably, quotes by famous historical figures form an important part of the syllabus for the UPSC CSE Essay paper. Also, themes around faith, religion, spirituality and wisdom have appeared in various forms in the UPSC examination, especially in the philosophical context. Questions have been asked about spirituality and scientific temper (2003) and ‘new cults and godmen: a threat to traditional religion’ (1996).</p>\n<h2><strong>The quote</strong></h2>\n<p>The full passage goes like this:</p>\n<p>“Any man who stands for progress has to criticise, disbelieve and challenge every item of the old faith. Item by item he has to reason out every nook and corner of the prevailing faith. If after considerable reasoning one is led to believe in any theory or philosophy, his faith is welcomed. His reasoning can be mistaken, wrong, misled, and sometimes fallacious. But he is liable to correction because reason is the guiding star of his life. But mere faith and blind faith is dangerous: it dulls the brain and makes a man reactionary.”</p>\n<p>In this passage, Bhagat Singh outlines why reason, rather than blind faith, should drive anyone who believes in progress. Singh uses the term ‘faith’ in two different ways in the above passage. First, as a synonym for religious beliefs (‘old faiths’) and second, simply as faith (complete trust or confidence in someone or something) itself.</p>\n<h2><strong>Bhagat Singh’s problem is not with faith itself but ‘blind faith’</strong></h2>\n<p>Singh writes that as long as reason is one’s ‘guiding star’, faith is welcome, even if it may be misplaced. This is because being reasonable presupposes being questioning and open to change one’s views. Our knowledge is fundamentally incomplete – there will always be ‘more to know’ than what is known at present. This means that our ‘faith’ has to reflect this.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>For instance, for the longest time, it was believed that the earth was at the centre of the universe. In fact people like Galileo who said otherwise were ridiculed and sometimes, even persecuted. Today, we know without a doubt that our planet is but a tiny, insignificant speck in the vast nothingness of the universe. This change in our ‘belief’ came with advancements in science and humankind’s collective gathering of knowledge. Mere faith in Earth’s uniqueness amidst overwhelming evidence otherwise would be dishonest and nonsensical.</p>\n<p>Similarly, ‘mere faith and blind faith’ in any fact, any religious teaching, in any god, is also ‘dangerous’.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/bhagat-singh-jawaharlal-nehru-8515080/\">How Nehru defended Bhagat Singh after his conviction: ‘This type of courage is rare’</a></div>\n<p><strong>Why is blind faith dangerous?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Bhagat Singh’s answer to this reflects his leftward leanings.</p>\n<p>Marx famously wrote in his introduction to ‘Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right’ (1844), “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people (often translated as ‘masses’).” Similarly, Singh says blind faith “dulls the brain”.</p>\n<p>While Marx is referring to religion more in its systematised and organised form, criticising religious institutions, Singh refers to it at a more individualistic level. However, for both the writers, religion and blind faith engender a certain kind of passivity in human beings. They make humans not question the injustice that surrounds them and blindly follow authority, even to their own detriment.</p>\n<p>It also makes them “reactionary” to criticism and censure. Even a completely reasonable challenge to someone’s beliefs can draw unreasonable, often violent, responses. Take for instance the opposition to recent Seattle anti-caste discrimination laws. While there can undoubtedly be debate regarding the specifics of the law as well as its efficacy, unequivocally calling them ‘anti-Hindu’ is a reactionary response, which does not engage with the very real discrimination faced by Dalits in India as well as abroad. After all, the law was made on the back of multiple instances of caste discrimination that have been recently <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/caste-in-california-tech-giants-confront-ancient-indian-hierarchy-8090852/\"><strong>reported</strong></a> in the United States.</p>\n<div><span>More from Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/unseeing-bhagat-singh-why-india-has-stopped-at-only-talking-about-him-7831838/\">Unseeing Bhagat Singh: Why India has stopped at only talking about him</a></div>\n<p>Bhagat Singh’s own example to substantiate this point is also interesting. He says, “Because Mahatamaji (Gandhi) is great, therefore none should criticise him. Because he has risen above, therefore everything he says —may be in the field of Politics or Religion, Economics or Ethics— is right. Whether you are convinced or not you must say: ‘Yes, that’s true’. This mentality does not lead towards progress. It is rather too obviously reactionary”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2><strong>The mark of a true revolutionary</strong></h2>\n<p>“Criticism and independent thinking are the two indispensable qualities of a revolutionary”, Bhagat Singh writes later in the essay. This is the larger point that the quote being discussed makes. By no means is believing in something itself bad. But when it is blind, and unquestioning, this belief can be dangerous. It is imperative for humans to continue to question what is in front of them, whether it be material conditions, seemingly infallible leaders or religion.</p>\n<p>In a country where Bhagat Singh remains one of the tallest national icons to date, it will be wise to think about his words and put them into action for once. In the face of the hold that dogma, superstition, and religious fundamentalism continue to have over the people of India, Bhagat Singh offers an alternative vision, one based on rationality and critical thought.</p>\n</div> ",

Tigers need large habitats to roam in and a significant prey base to hunt. As forests were cut down for development activities and as human habitats extended into forests, the tiger’s habitat came under stress. Smaller habitats meant more competition for prey, more inbreeding, and more human-animal conflict.</p>\n<p>Also, tigers were killed for their valuable body parts. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), “Every part of the tiger—from whisker to tail—has been found in illegal wildlife markets. A result of persistent demand, their bones, and other body parts are used for modern health tonics and folk remedies, and their skins are sought after as status symbols among some Asian cultures.”</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/keralas-man-elephant-conflict-tusker-padayappa-8400255/\">Understanding Kerala’s man-elephant conflict</a></div>\n<p>The last tiger spotted on a camera trap in Cambodia was in 2007. In April 2016, Cambodia announced that tigers were “functionally extinct”, meaning no breeding populations of the animal were left in the  country.</p>\n<p><strong>Why translocate from India?</strong></p>\n<p morss_own_score=\"7.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">As far back as in 2016, Keo Omaliss, Cambodia’s director of the department of wildlife and biodiversity at the Forestry Administration, had been quoted as saying by the <em>AFP</em> that “we want two male tigers and five to six females tigers for the start”, and that “talks had begun with countries including India, Thailand and Malaysia” for this.</p>\n<p>However, wildlife experts had then said that before reintroducing the animal, Cambodia needed to address the problems that had led to their extinction in the first place. Cambodia has since been making efforts to make its forests more hospitable for the big cat.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Thirteen countries make up the tiger range of the world — Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Thailand and Vietnam. In 2010, these countries had met and adopted a goal to double their tiger population by 2022. <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/50-years-of-project-tiger-india-considers-translocating-a-few-big-cats-to-cambodia-8517687/\">India reached the goal before that year</a></strong>, and, with the current population of about 3,000 tigers, harbours more than 70% of the global wild tiger population. The animal has gone extinct in Laos and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>The Indochinese tiger found in Cambodia is smaller than the Royal Bengal tiger, but they are the same subspecies. According to the WWF, “since2017, IUCN has recognised two tiger subspecies, commonly referred toas the continental tiger and the Sunda island tiger. All remaining island tigers are found only in Sumatra, with tigers in Java and Bali now extinct. These are popularly known as Sumatran tigers. The continental tigers currently include the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese and Amur (Siberian) tiger populations, while the Caspian tiger is extinct in the wild. The South China tiger is believed to be functionally extinct.”</p>\n<span><img src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/tigerss-749.jpg\"> The Sumatran tiger (left) is smaller than the continental tiger, and has a distinctive beard and mane. (Wikimedia Commons/Express photo by Gurmeet Singh)</span>\n<p>India translocates tigers within the country, but has never done so internationally. Before the animals are sent to Cambodia, there are checks to be conducted. SP Yadav, member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), said, “We will <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/50-years-of-project-tiger-india-considers-translocating-a-few-big-cats-to-cambodia-8517687/\">have to look at many factors before taking a decision</a></strong>. To begin with, we have to verify whether the reasons for tiger disappearance in Cambodia have been addressed, whether they have the requisite facilities and infrastructure to support the tiger.”</p>\n<p><strong>What is Cambodia doing to reintroduce the tiger?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>According to non-profit Wildlife Alliance which works in Cambodia, one of the possible sites of tiger reintroduction is the Cardamom Rainforest Landscape, which offers “a vast expanse of forest cover, grasslands, and wetlands that are ideal for tiger reintroduction. These protected areas include the Southern Cardamom National Park, Tatai Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary.”</p>\n<p>In these areas, the Wildlife Alliance website says, an inviolate core zone of more than 2,000 sqkm has been “created and secured”; three tiger prey base surveys have been conducted, “finding good tiger prey density”; more patrol rangers to prevent poaching are “strategically situated around the Tiger Core Zone”; and the local communities are being engaged in the conservation efforts.</p>\n<p>A successful reintroduction of the tiger will not only mean increased tourism income for Cambodia, but also restore ecological balance by introducing an apex predator. Also, as WWF says, “Tigers are an umbrella species, which means when they are conserved, it also helps to conserve many other species. Tiger conservation brings the highest levels of protection for an area as well as an increase in funds and capacity.”</p>\n</div> </div>\n",

What is its significance across cultures? Are all New Years the same?</p>\n<p><strong>How is Nowruz, the Iranian New Year, defined?</strong>`</p><p>Nowruz begins on the first day of the Farvardin, the first month of the Iranian solar calendar at the spring equinox, and continues for 12 days. While Ali Shariati, a published author in the journal of <em>Iranian Studies</em>, describes it as “the climax of blossoming, the anxiety of births,” and a festival “filled with the excitement of every “beginning”,” authors SNR Rizvi and Poonam Pant, who attempt a historical reconstruction of the festival in their works, consider it as “a festival of renewal, hope, and happiness.”</p>\n<p>In India, the Iranian New Year is celebrated with ardour — people visit the Fire Temple, the place of worship of the Parsi community, decorate their houses, prepare delicacies, and perform rituals based on the movements of the sun during the course of the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Origins of the festival</strong></p>\n<p>The origins of the festival are, however, unclear.</p>\n<p>Hewa Salim Khalid, an analyst, in the article, <em>Newroz from Kurdish and Persian Perspectives – A Comparative Study</em>, delves deep into diverse cultural perceptions about the festival among Kurdish and Persian communities, and what it stands for them.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/holi-look-at-the-tradition-of-consuming-bhang-in-india-8484362/\">On Holi, a look at the tradition of consuming bhang in India</a></div>\n<p>While for the Kurds, Nowruz stands as a symbol of resistance, for Persians, it is purely a cultural festival. It is observed as a celebration of Kurdish national identity — it is more about establishment of a state identity. According to the Kurdish mythology, <em>Kawa</em>, the Blacksmith and their ancestor killed <em>Zuhak</em>, the tyrant, marking a new day for Kurds. Soon after, <em>Deiokes</em>, who was “chosen by seven Kurdish tribes to build the Median Empire … succeeded in building the empire,” Khalid’s research says.</p>\n<p>As Kurds did not have an independent state in what is referred to as “modern history,” and their cultures remained influenced by cultures of four nation-states, namely, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, Nowruz, for them, entails a political dimension. Kurdish people in these four countries observe distinct rituals on the day of the festival, but one common link between these rituals is that the festival is a mark of Kurdish resistance against oppression. It is a day when they “demand freedom, peace, and independence.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Khalid’s analysis also deconstructs the Persian myth for the readers. For Persians, even though they narrate the stories of <em>Kawa</em> and <em>Zuhak</em> in their folktales, they trace back the festival to <em>Jamshid</em>, a legendary ancient ruler “fought against winter, went above the earth into the heavens, and … was shining like the sun.”</p>\n<p>For Persians, it is a “reminder of values that bind all people together with the aim of mutual understanding, unity, and peace,” Khalid states.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, these days, the festival, in both the nations, stands as a “symbol of national identity” and as a tourism resource.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the festival mean according to the UNESCO?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the International Day of Nowruz in 2010. The festival had also been listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2016. Terming it as a day which marks the “renewal of nature,” the UNESCO describes it as a festival which “promotes values of peace and solidarity between generations and within families as well as reconciliation and neighborliness.”</p>\n<p><strong>Brief history of Parsi community in India</strong></p>\n<p>Following religious persecution in Iran, Parsis arrived in India in 936 AC, and sought refuge under the Hindu King of Gujarat, Jadav Rana, according to a chronicle, <em>Qissa-i-Sanjan,</em> written in the 17th century. They continued to preserve their culture and religious identity in India, as they built the first fire temple, <em>Atash Behram</em>, to shelter their holy fire which they had rescued from Iran. The sacred fire is now located in a temple in Udvada, Gujarat, which has become the heart of the Parsi culture in India.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/surat/\">Surat</a> had become a major trade centre for the community by the 16th century. As a large part of this community included weavers and artisans, according to a publication available on the official website of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), the British willingly conducted businesses in the country through the community.</p>\n<p>In the present times, about 70 per cent of Parsis are concentrated in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/\">Mumbai</a> (earlier Bombay), and are intimately connected to the city.</p>\n<p><strong>How do Parsis celebrate the festival?</strong></p>\n<p>Nowruz, across Central Asia, is celebrated by weaving <em>Toran</em>, an ornated gateway; chalk making (similar to the Hindu tradition of making rangolis), and “taking around the Loban (frankincense) in the act of ritual purity,” according to an article, Jamshedi-Navroze — Myth, History and Comtemporary Practice, by Parzor Foundation.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The preparations begin in March with the sprouting of Sabzeh (lentil, wheat or barley) and Khane Tekani (house cleaning), followed by <em>Kharid-i-Nowruz</em>, or shopping for Nowruz, according to Dr Shernaz Cama, Director, UNESCO Parzor Project.</p>\n<p>Cama says, “Navroze, necessarily entails a ‘Jashan’ of thanksgiving in the morning — a core religious ceremony which brings all creations together with the recitation from the Yasna Text.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The festival marks a “unique site of community cohesion,” as “the Zoroastrian community experiences the diaspora and population decline over the years,” Cama writes.</p>\n</div> ",

It carried a report of the 2nd ODI between India and Australia at Visakhapatnam where the Indian batting order crumbled before the Aussie swing.</p><p>Like a plethora of such words, nemesis has its roots in Greek mythology, and stands for the goddess of retribution and punishment who humbled the proud and arrogant. Hence, a successful person feared to offend her, for if he became too haughty, his downfall might follow. Today, the word is used to denote an avenger or punisher and also the punishment itself. In the sports pages, nemesis is applied to an athlete or a sportsperson who consistently beats an opponent. The report mentioned above talked about how the swing generated by left-arm pacers has been the nemesis of India’s batting order.</p>\n<p>Another word, with an interesting etymology, on one of the sports pages was <strong>sophomore</strong>. It appeared last week in a report about the stellar performance of Indian women’s pair Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand at the All England Open Badminton Championships: “On Wednesday, at their sophomore All England, Treesa-Gayatri showed no second-season blues as they went about dismantling…” experienced opponents.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Wordly Wise</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/do-you-know-the-many-words-english-owes-to-indian-languages-8505225/\">My brother, do you know naatu? Also, do you know the many words English owes to Indian languages?</a></div>\n<p>The word means a student in the second year of a course of study at a college or a university. It also refers to something associated with the second in a series. It was the second successive appearance of the two badminton players at the championship.</p>\n<p>According to a popular folk etymology, it is a portmanteau of Greek words ‘sophos’ (meaning clever or wise) and ‘moros’ (meaning foolish or dull). So, the literal meaning of sophomore would be ‘a wise fool’. Another etymological line is that it derives from an earlier English term, ‘sophumer’, a variation of Greek ‘sophism’ (clever device). A sophist is literally one who is wise but the term became derogatory in Greek culture because it seemed a little unwise, or even arrogant, to proclaim about one’s own wisdom.</p>\n<p>At Cambridge University, the second- and third-year students were called ‘sophisters’ (the first-year students were freshmen) probably because their knowledge and argument were not mature enough. Gradually, the term became sophomore.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p><strong>Sophistry</strong>, which comes from the same root word meaning wise, has a negative connotation and is used as a synonym for evasive and fallacious reasoning.</p>\n<p>I stumbled upon <strong>Trojan horse</strong> while going through a political report on how the ruling coalition in Jharkhand survived the rival’s plan to topple it, thanks to a legislator who was privy to the plan because of his friendship with the key players and alerted the parties in power.</p>\n<p>This one too has a Greek origin. In the 10th year of the Trojan War, after several unsuccessful attempts to capture Troy, the Greeks resorted to stratagem. They constructed a colossal wooden horse, filled it with armed men, and managed by trickery to have the unsuspecting Trojans draw the horse inside the city. At night, the Greek soldiers came out of the horse’s belly and captured Troy.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Though the wooden horse was a Greek subterfuge, it is called the Trojan horse, an expression which has become a symbol of treacherous infiltration, a fifth column.</p>\n<p>In the digital age, Trojan horse has also come to refer to a computer programme that appears helpful but is designed to destroy data.</p>\n<p>The Greek legacy is indeed copious and without it the English language will lose much of its sheen.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Wordly Wise is a weekly column by Amitabh Ranjan published every Saturday in the Explained section.

His grandmother and former Prime Minister of India lost her MP status on June 12, 1975, owing to a <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/june-13-forty-years-ago-the-verdict/\"><strong>decision of the Allahabad High Court</strong></a>, which found her guilty of corrupt electoral practices in the 1971 general elections and consequently invalidated her victory in the election.</p><h2>Why was the case filed against her in Allahabad High Court?</h2>\n<p>The case “Raj Narain vs Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi” decided by Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha of the Allahabad High Court would go on to radically change the course of India’s politics. The case was filed by Samyukta Socialist Party member Raj Narain after he lost the 1971 <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/\">Lok Sabha</a> elections to Gandhi.</p>\n<p>In his petition before the Allahabad High Court, Raj Narain challenged Indira Gandhi’s election on grounds that she committed various corrupt practices under Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which defines the grounds to declare an election as null and void.</p>\n<p>Narain’s plea accused Gandhi of corrupt electoral practices, as laid down under Sections 123(5), 123(6), 123(3), and 123(7) of the RP Act, 1951, which relate to electors hiring vehicles for the purpose of conveying people to the polling booths, exceeding the prescribed limit for election expenditure, appealing for votes on the basis of religion and using government functionaries for the furtherance of her election prospects, respectively.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/rahul-gandhi-perks-and-benefits-8518345/\">Rahul Gandhi disqualified as MP: here are the perks and benefits he is set to lose</a></div>\n<p>In his election petition, Narain alleged that Gandhi, along with her former OSD and election agent, Yashpal Kapur, had spent more than the expenditure amount prescribed under Section 77 of the Representation of the People Act, read with Rule 90 of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961.</p>\n<h2>What is an election petition?</h2>\n<p>An election petition challenges the result of an election before the High Court of any state within 45 days from the declaration of polling results. Essentially, it challenges the validity of a candidate’s election. While hearing such pleas, a high court takes on the powers of a trial court, such as cross-examination of witnesses and looking at the evidence.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What did the Allahabad HC decide?</h2>\n<p>The Allahabad High Court found Gandhi guilty of indulging in “corrupt practices” under Section 123 (7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which deals with the use of government servants or officers for the furtherance of a candidate’s election. The use of police, army personnel, judges, magistrates, and gazetted officers falls under this subsection of the RPA.</p>\n<p>The Court observed that Gandhi had used the services of her former Officer on Special Duty (OSD) Yashpal Kapur along with the aid of Raebareli District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police to set up a stage, loudspeakers, and barricades for her election campaign.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-the-lily-thomas-rahul-gandhi-8515037/\">Rahul Gandhi disqualified as MP: here are the perks and benefits he is set to lose</a></div>\n<p>Although Gandhi had appointed Kapur as her election agent following a resignation tendered by him to the PM Secretariat on January 13, 1971, a month before the commencement of her campaigning for elections, the Secretariat did not issue a notification confirming his resignation till January 25, 1971.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Moreover, even before that, on January 7, Kapur was seen giving speeches on behalf of Gandhi, while he was still in service as a gazetted officer. This led to the High Court concluding that Section 123 (7) of the RPA had indeed been violated.</p>\n<p>On June 12, 1975, the High Court held that Gandhi had “held herself out as a candidate from December 29, 1970” and “was guilty of having committed corrupt practice by having obtained the assistance of gazetted officers in furtherance of her election prospects”. Consequently, she was disqualified from Parliament and from holding any elected post, for a period of six years from the date of this decision onwards.</p>\n<p>This resulted in Gandhi filing an appeal before the Apex Court.</p>\n<h2>What did the SC rule?</h2>\n<p>On June 24, 1975, a vacation bench of Justice VR Krishna Iyer of the Supreme Court in “Indira Nehru Gandhi (Smt.) vs Raj Narain &amp; Anr” allowed a partial stay on the Allahabad High Court order disqualifying Indira Gandhi as an MP.</p>\n<p>The Apex Court said that while it would allow Gandhi to continue as Prime Minister, she would still be debarred from voting in parliamentary proceedings. Moreover, she could not draw her salary as an MP.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“Consequentially, the disqualification imposed upon the appellant as a statutory sequel under s. 8A of the Act and as forming part of the judgment and order impugned will also be suspended. That is to say, the petitioner will remain a Member of the Lok Sabha for all purposes except to the extent restricted by para III so long as the stay order lasts,” the Court said in its judgment.</p>\n<p>The conditional stay granted by the Apex Court in its interim order prompted Gandhi to declare the National Emergency on June 25, 1975, on grounds of “internal disturbance” under Article 352 of the Constitution, merely a day after Justice Krishna Iyer’s decision. During this period of Emergency, Gandhi passed the Thirty-Ninth Amendment to the Constitution, introducing Article 329A, which said that the PM or Speaker’s election cannot be challenged in a court of law and can solely be challenged by Parliament instead.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Following this on November 7, 1975, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the then CJI AN Ray unanimously upheld Gandhi’s 1971 election, setting aside the earlier Allahabad High Court and Vacation Bench rulings. However, in 1977 when the Janata Government came to power, it decided to do away with Article 329A, by way of the Forty-Fourth Amendment, which came into effect from June 20, 1979.</p>\n</div> ",

In 2014, a Bhiwandi court summoned him in another defamation case under Sections 499 and 500 IPC, based on a complaint filed by RSS activist Rajesh Kunte Mishra.</p>\n<p><strong>What happened before the Bhiwandi court?</strong></p><p>In 2014, a criminal complaint was filed against <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a> for allegedly blaming the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The complaint filed by an RSS activist alleged that Gandhi, during a public rally organised by the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/indian-national-congress/\">Indian National Congress</a> in Bhiwandi, Maharashtra, ahead of the 2014 <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/\">Lok Sabha</a> polls, had stated, “This is their style. Gandhiji was killed by them; persons from the RSS. Shot Gandhiji. And today their people talk of Gandhiji.”</p>\n<p>On the basis of allegations in Mishra’s complaint that Gandhi had made the statements intending to harm the reputation of the RSS and its members, a criminal case was registered against him by the 3rd Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Bhiwandi, under Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code, which define defamation and its consequent punishment.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/explained-law-rahuls-disqualification-after-8517591/\">Rahul Gandhi disqualified: What this means, what happens next?</a></div>\n<p>After this, Gandhi approached the Bombay High Court seeking quashing of the summons and the proceedings initiated against him before the Bhiwandi court.</p>\n<p><strong>What did the Bombay HC say?</strong></p>\n<p>On March 10, 2015, single-judge bench of ML Tahaliyani of the Bombay High Court in “Rahul Gandhi vs. Rajesh Mahadev Kunte” refused to quash either the summons or the proceedings against Gandhi in the defamation case at the Bhiwandi court.</p>\n<p>“In my opinion, unless it is established that the statement was made in good faith, offence defined under section 499 and punishable under section 500 of the IPC would be made out,” the Bombay High Court held.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The Court also reasoned that it did not deem this case as “exceptional” or fit for exercising its quashing powers under section 482 of CrPC. “Powers of section 482 of CrPC are required to be exercised sparingly,” the Court added.</p>\n<p>The lack of relief rendered by the Bombay High Court caused Gandhi to seek respite from the Apex Court.</p>\n<p><strong>What did the Apex Court rule?</strong></p>\n<p>On September 1, 2016, a two-judge bench of Justices Dipak Mishra and Rohinton Fali Nariman of the Apex Court allowed Rahul Gandhi to withdraw his plea seeking quashing of defamation proceedings against him before the Bhiwandi court. The decision to withdraw Gandhi’s plea was taken by Senior advocate Kapil Sibal following the Court’s refusal to interfere with the Bombay High Court order.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>This decision came on a fresh petition titled “Rahul Gandhi vs. Rajesh Mahadev Kunte &amp; Another” filed before the Supreme Court on May 14, 2016. What distinguished this plea from the previous ones was that Gandhi had challenged the constitutional validity of Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC this time. However, the Apex Court dismissed this challenge, relying upon its 2016 ruling in the case of “Subramanian Swamy vs. Union of India.”</p>\n<p>“Needless to say, if any observation has been made by the High Court while disposing of the writ petition, the same shall be confined to be stated for the purpose of disposal of the writ petition and the trial Magistrate shall proceed in accordance with law without being influenced by any of the observations made by the High Court,” the Court held.</p>\n<p><strong>What was the Subramaniam Swamy case?</strong></p>\n<p>In its 2016 ruling in “Subramanian Swamy vs Union of India”, a bench of Justices Dipak Mishra and Prafulla C Pant of the Apex Court upheld the constitutionality of criminal defamation under Sections 499 and 500 IPC. The Court said that the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression must be balanced against the right to reputation. The Court also stated that the offence of criminal defamation does not violate freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution and is a proportionate or reasonable restriction as per the law laid down in Article 19 (2).</p>\n<p>The Court also said that while the right to free speech and dissent exist in a democracy, it cannot mean that a citizen can defame another as protection of reputation is a fundamental right as well as a human right.</p>\n<p>“In view of the aforesaid analysis, we uphold the constitutional validity of Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,” the Court said in its judgment dated May 13, 2016.</p>\n</div> ",

The International Energy Agency says widespread bids to beef up energy security “turbocharged” growth of green power in 2022, and EU parliamentarians hope to ramp up renewables targets to reach 45% of bloc-wide energy consumption by 2030.</p><p>The word “renewable” often conjures up images of wind farms or solar panels — less so scenes of burning trees. But biomass, which includes firewood, plants and other organic materials, makes up 60% of the EU’s renewable energy mix according to the European Commission.</p>\n<p>As the bloc now reviews its landmark renewable power legislation, a political battle over firewood’s future is playing out in Brussels.</p>\n<h2>EU accused of incentivizing environmental harm</h2>\n<p>Because new trees can be planted after others have been chopped down, firewood gets the <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/decarbonisation-coal-based-electricity-the-difficulty-with-renewables-8461380/\">renewable</a></strong> seal of approval under EU law. That means member countries can subsidize wood burning, as long as certain sustainable sourcing rules are met.</p>\n<p>But Martin Pigeon of Brussels-based forest protection campaign group Fern argues the subsidy setup is “insane” as it means “EU citizens are paying energy companies to burn forests in the midst of a climate and biodiversity crisis.”</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ipcc-synthesis-key-takeaways-8510544/\">IPCC releases its Synthesis Report: What are the key takeaways</a></div>\n<p>Industry groups refute these claims. Bioenergy Europe is a Brussels-based nonprofit focused on raising “awareness, acceptance and reputation of bioenergy.” The organization represents more than 150 energy companies and 40 associations — and Policy Officer Irene Di Padua told <em>DW</em> in written comments that responsibly sourced biomass “is essential for the EU’s green transition, especially in providing renewable heat.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“Bioenergy needs to comply with strict sustainability criteria that ensure sourcing and use of biomass for energy does not cause any environmental harm or biodiversity loss,” she said.</p>\n<p>Martin Pigeon, however, argues that those criteria are “not strict.”</p>\n<h2>Climate impact of wood-burning under debate</h2>\n<p>The climate impact of wood-burning is contested. The EU officially counts wood and other biomass as carbon neutral, based on the premise that CO2 emitted through burning will be reabsorbed by more trees in the future.

          "title": "Why executions by firing squad may be coming back in the US",
          "description": "",
          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"4.816753926701571\" morss_score=\"91.31675392670158\"><p><em><strong>(Written by Michael Tarmap)</strong></em></p>\n<p>The image of gunmen in a row firing in unison at a condemned prisoner may conjure up a bygone, less enlightened era. But the idea of using firing squads is making a comeback. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill this week seeking to add the state to the list of those authorizing firing squads, which currently includes Mississippi, Utah, Oklahoma and South Carolina.</p><p>Fresh interest comes as states scramble for alternatives to lethal injections after pharmaceutical companies barred the use of their drugs. Some, including a few Supreme Court justices, view firing squads as less cruel than lethal injections, despite the violence involved in riddling bodies with bullets. Others say it’s not so cut-and-dry, or that there are other factors to consider.</p>\n<p>A look at the status of firing squads in the United States.</p>\n<h2>When was the last execution by firing squad?</h2>\n<p>Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed at Utah State Prison on June 18, 2010, for killing an attorney during a courthouse escape attempt.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/debate-over-mode-of-capital-punishment-explained-8510590/\">Hanging, or something else as death penalty? Before Supreme Court, a case around the mode of capital punishment</a></div>\n<p>Gardner sat in a chair, sandbags around him and a target pinned over his heart. Five prison staffers drawn from a pool of volunteers fired from 25 feet (about 8 meters) away with .30-caliber rifles. Gardner was pronounced dead two minutes later. A blank cartridge was loaded into one rifle without anyone knowing which. That’s partly done to enable those bothered later by their participation to believe they may not have fired a fatal bullet.</p>\n<p>Utah is the only state to have used firing squads in the past 50 years, according to the Washington, DC-based Death Penalty Information Center.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What has caused the lethal drug scarcity?</h2>\n<p>Under Idaho’s bill, firing squads would be used only if executioners can’t obtain the drugs required for lethal injections. As lethal injection became the primary execution method in the 2000s, drug companies began barring use of their drugs, saying they were meant to save lives, not take them.</p>\n<p>States have found it difficult to obtain the cocktail of drugs they long relied on, such as sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Some have switched to more accessible drugs such as pentobarbital or midazolam, both of which, critics say, can cause excruciating pain.</p>\n<p>Other states have reauthorized the use of electric chairs and gas chambers — or are at least considering doing so. That’s where firing squads come in.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Are they more humane?</h2>\n<p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor is among those who say firing squads are a more humane method of execution. That idea is based on expectations that bullets will strike the heart, rupturing it and causing immediate unconsciousness as the inmate quickly bleeds to death.“In addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless,” Sotomayor wrote in a 2017 dissent.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/donald-trump-arrest-charges-stormy-daniels-case-explained-8511839/\">Why Donald Trump faces arrest, and the probable charges against him</a></div>\n<p>Her comments came in the case of an Alabama inmate who asked to be executed by firing squad. A Supreme Court majority refused to hear his appeal. In her dissent, Sotomayor said lethal drugs can mask intense pain by paralyzing inmates while they are still sentient. “What cruel irony that the method that appears most humane may turn out to be our most cruel experiment yet,” she wrote.</p>\n<h2>But is death by firing squad really painless?</h2>\n<p>In a 2019 federal case, prosecutors submitted statements from anesthesiologist Joseph Antognini, who said painless deaths by firing squads are not guaranteed. Inmates could remain conscious for up to 10 seconds after being shot depending on where bullets strike, Antognini said, and those seconds could be “severely painful, especially related to shattering of bone and damage to the spinal cord.”</p>\n<p>Others note that killings by firing squad are visibly violent and bloody compared with lethal injections, potentially traumatizing victims’ relatives and other witnesses as well as executioners and staffers who clean up afterward.</p>\n<h2>Are firing squads more reliable?</h2>\n<p>If reliability means the condemned are more likely to die as intended, then one could make that argument. An Amherst College political science and law professor, Austin Sarat, studied 8,776 executions in the U.S. between 1890 and 2010 and found that 276 of them were botched, or 3.15%.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/protests-macrons-pension-reforms-penchant-to-protest-8512895/\">Agitation against Macron’s pension reforms: Understanding France’s ‘penchant to protest’</a></div>\n<p>The executions that went wrong included 7.12% of all lethal injections — in one notorious 2014 case in Oklahoma, Clayton Locket writhed and clenched his teeth after midazolam was administered — as well as 3.12% of hangings and 1.92% of electrocutions.</p>\n<p>By contrast, not a single one of the 34 firing squad executions was found to have been botched, according to Sarat, who has called for an end to capital punishment. The Death Penalty Information Center, however, has identified at least one firing squad execution that reportedly went awry: In 1879, in Utah territory, riflemen missed Wallace Wilkerson’s heart and it took 27 minutes for him to die.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Were firing squads ever in wide use?</h2>\n<p>Firing squads have never been a predominant method of carrying out civilian death sentences and are more closely associated with the military, including the execution of Civil War deserters.</p>\n<p>From colonial days through 2002, more than 15,000 people were put to death, according to data compiled by death penalty researchers M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla. Just 143 died by firing squad, compared with 9,322 by hanging and 4,426 by electrocution.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Has the Supreme Court weighed in?</h2>\n<p>High court rulings have required inmates who oppose an existing execution method to offer an alternative. They must prove both that the alternative is “significantly” less painful and that the infrastructure exists to implement the alternative method.</p>\n<p>That has led to the spectacle of inmate attorneys bringing multiple cases in which they argue the merits of firing squads. In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in Bucklew v. Precythe that some pain does not automatically mean a method of execution constitutes “cruel and unusual” punishment, which is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. The Constitution “does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death — something that, of course, isn’t guaranteed to many people,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the 5-4 majority.</p>\n<p>Key factors in deciding whether a method is “cruel and unusual” include whether it adds extra pain “beyond what’s needed to effectuate a death sentence,” Gorsuch said.</p>\n</div> ",

Meanwhile, on Thursday, Block’s shares plunged by 15 per cent, losing all the gains made so far this year, before the New York Stock Exchange closed for the day.</p><p>The company has denied all the allegations, saying that Hindenburg’s report is “factually inaccurate and misleading”. It also said it will work with the US securities regulator to explore legal action against the short seller company, <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>\n<p>The report has come just two months after Hindenburg in its investigation <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-is-hindenburg-research-accused-adani-fraud-8404531/\"><strong>accused the Adani Group companies of engaging “in a brazen stock manipulation</strong></a> and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades”. This caused a heavy loss of around $100 billion to the conglomerate.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the allegations against Block?</strong></p>\n<p>The main focus of Hindenburg’s report is Block’s Cash App — a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment application that allows users to quickly send, receive and invest money. According to <em>Forbes</em>, it was launched in 2013 in order to compete with other mobile payment apps like Venmo and PayPal.</p>\n<p>“Cash App is a financial platform, not a bank. It provides banking services and debit cards through its bank partners.,” the news outlet said.</p>\n<p>Hindenburg has claimed to have talked to former Block employees who estimated that 40 per cent to 70 per cent of Cash App’s accounts they reviewed were fake, involved in fraud, or were additional accounts tied to a single individual.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>It said, “Block obfuscates how many individuals are on the Cash App platform by reporting misleading ‘transacting active’ metrics filled with fake and duplicate accounts. Block can and should clarify to investors an estimate on how many unique people actually use Cash App.”</p>\n<p>The short seller in its report also alleged that the platform has been used to facilitate criminal activities, including sex trafficking and fraud.</p>\n<p>“Cash App was also cited ‘by far’ as the top app used in reported US sex trafficking, according to a leading non-profit organisation. Multiple Department of Justice complaints outline how Cash App has been used to facilitate sex trafficking, including sex trafficking of minors.,” the report mentioned.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>It further alleged that even when the users were caught engaging in fraud or other prohibited activity, Block blacklisted the account without banning the user. “This phenomenon of allowing blacklisted users was so common that rappers bragged about it in hip-hop songs.,” the report said.</p>\n<p>Apart from this, the short seller’s investigation also revealed that when Block’s share price soared “on the back of its facilitation of fraud” during the pandemic, co-founders Dorsey and James McKelvey collectively sold over $1 billion of stock. Other executives including finance chief Amrita Ahuja and the lead manager for Cash App Brian Grassadonia also dumped millions of dollars in stock, the report added.</p>\n<p>Speaking to <em>Reuters</em> about the investigation, Christopher Brendler, senior analyst at DA Davidson &amp; Co., said, “What I am really concerned about is the Cash App, accusations of fraud, multiple accounts, opening accounts and fake names. And it doesn’t seem like that would be something that they would allow”.</p>\n<p>“(There is) some evidence in the report that this is happening. So, you know, I think that’s the most damaging part of the report,” he pointed out</p>\n<p>The Hindenburg’s report has further added to Block’s headache as its shares have continued to slump since last year due to worries about a slowdown in economic activity and consumer spending. Moreover, “Block has also taken a hit from the upheaval in the cryptocurrency industry that forms a large chunk of its revenue base,” <em>Reuters</em> said.</p>\n</div> ",

Anil Sharma</span>\n<h2>Why has the Lok Sabha Secretariat issued this notification?</h2>\n<p>It is part of the procedure. In a note on October 13, 2015, the Election Commission of India had asked state chief secretaries to issue appropriate instructions to the department dealing with prosecutions to ensure that cases of conviction of sitting MPs or MLAs were brought to the notice of the Speaker or Chairman of the House, and to the Chief Electoral Officer of the state, along with the order of conviction within seven days of the order.</p>\n<p>Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 states that “a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release.”</p>\n<p>Thus, the disqualification is triggered by the conviction itself, and not by the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/\">Lok Sabha</a> notification. The notification is merely a formal notice to Rahul, who was in Lok Sabha on Friday before the House was adjourned.</p>\n<p>In the case of a disqualified MLA, the notice is issued by the Vidhan Sabha concerned. For example, in the case of <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/samajwadi-party/\">Samajwadi Party</a> MLA Azam Khan, the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly Secretariat issued the notice of disqualification in October last year.</p>\n<h2>Is the authority of the Speaker final in this regard?</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court in its ruling in Lok Prahari v Union of India (2018) clarified that a disqualification triggered by a conviction will be reversed if the conviction is stayed by a court. “Once the conviction has been stayed during the pendency of an appeal, the disqualification which operates as a consequence of the conviction cannot take or remain in effect,” the ruling said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The notification by the House Secretariat regarding Rahul will cease to be in effect if and when his conviction is stayed.</p>\n<h2>What are Article 102(1)(e) of the Constitution and Section 8 of the RP Act?</h2>\n<p>Article 102 of the Constitution deals with grounds for disqualification of a parliamentarian.</p>\n<p>Sub-clause (e) of Article 102(1) says an MP will lose his membership of the House “if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament”. The law in this case is the RP Act.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Section 8 of the RP Act deals with disqualification of a lawmaker for conviction in certain offences. The provision is aimed at “preventing criminalisation of politics and keeping ‘tainted’ lawmakers from contesting elections.</p>\n<h2>What does Rahul lose along with his membership of Lok Sabha?</h2>\n<p>As a Lok Sabha MP, Rahul was entitled to a house in Lutyens’ <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a>. Following his disqualification, he will have one month to vacate his 12 Tughlak Lane home, according to sources in the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry. Rahul had been allotted the house after being elected MP from Amethi in 2004.</p>\n<p>The Lok Sabha Secretariat has sent a copy of the disqualification notification to the liaison officer of the Directorate of Estates for further action. The sources said since the bungalow belongs to the Lok Sabha pool of residential properties, the action for its vacation would have to be initiated by the Lok Sabha Secretariat.</p>\n<p>Rahul also loses all other perks that a Member of Parliament enjoys.</p>\n<h2>When do the people of Wayanad get a representative back in Lok Sabha?</h2>\n<p>The Election Commission can announce a byelection to the seat — in Azam Khan’s case, the schedule for the byelection to Khan’s 37-Rampur seat (along with byelections to fill four other vacancies across the country) was announced within a few days.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>However, in the more recent case of Lakshadweep MP P P Mohammed Faisal, the EC, which had announced the bypoll on January 18 after the MP’s conviction, had to withdraw the announcement on January 30 after Faisal’s conviction was suspended by the Kerala High Court on January 25.</p>\n<h2>What options are available to Rahul Gandhi here onward?</h2>\n<p>His disqualification can be reversed if a higher court grants a stay on the conviction or decides the appeal in his favour. His first appeal would have to be before the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/surat/\">Surat</a> Sessions Court, and then before the Gujarat High Court.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>If he does not get relief from the courts, he will be disqualified from contesting elections for eight years — two years of his sentence, plus six years under the provisions of the RP Act.</p>\n<p>His lawyer Kirit Panwala moved an application before the Surat court on Friday seeking time to file an appeal.</p>\n</div> ",

However, the World Athletics Council has set up a working group to conduct research “to further consider the issue of transgender inclusion”.</p><p>“We are not saying ‘no’ forever,” WA president Sebastian Coe said.</p>\n<p>The former double Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 metres emphasised on “fair and meaningful” female competition. “Decisions are always difficult when they involve conflicting needs and rights between different groups, but we continue to take the view that we must maintain fairness for female athletes above all other considerations,” Coe said.</p>\n<h2>Why have transgender women been barred?</h2>\n<p>In its ‘Eligibility Regulations for Transgender Athletes’, WA focuses on the physical advantages men have over women post-puberty. “The substantial sex difference in sports performance that emerges from puberty onwards means that the only way to achieve the objectives set out…is to maintain separate classifications (competition categories) for male and female athletes,” WA states.</p>\n<p>The debate has raged since New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard competed in the women’s 87-kg class at the Tokyo Olympics, although she had participated in the men’s category earlier.</p>\n<p>NCAA swimmer Lia Thomas used hormone replacement therapy and moved from the men’s category to the women’s category. She started breaking records in the IVY League competition before FINA stepped in.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What were the rules for transgender women before WA’s ban?</h2>\n<p>Under the previous rules, there was no blanket ban, but transgender women had to reduce the amount of blood testosterone to 5 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L) and maintain this level for 12 months in order to participate.</p>\n<h2>What had WA initially proposed?</h2>\n<p>In January, WA had come up with the ‘preferred option’ for transgender women. Instead of a complete ban, WA said it would allow transgender women to compete in the female category but would reduce the blood testosterone limit to below 2.5nmol/L for two years — basically cutting it down by half, and doubling the time period before they become eligible to compete.</p>\n<h2>So how did WA justify the change to a ban?</h2>\n<p>On Thursday, after its council meeting, WA said that the ‘preferred option’ did not have any takers. During January and February, WA said, it had consulted member federations, Global Athletics Coaches Academy, the Athletes’ Commission, the International Olympic Council, “as well as representative transgender and human rights groups”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“It became apparent that there was little support within the sport for the option that was first presented to stakeholders,” WA said in its statement.</p>\n<h2>Which other sports have banned transgender female athletes?</h2>\n<p>The International Olympic Committee’s Framework on Fairness released in November 2021 stated that “athletes are not excluded solely on the basis of their transgender identity or sex variations”.</p>\n<p>But the IOC had put the onus on sports federations to put in place rules. FINA implemented a ban last year.</p>\n<p>However, it was World Rugby in 2020 which became the first international sports federation to bar transgender women from the female competition. Following this, Rugby Football League and Rugby Football Union also banned transgender women from the female competition.</p>\n<p>Last year, British Triathlon implemented a similar ban.</p>\n<h2>Have any famous sporting names weighed in?</h2>\n<p>Tennis great and gay rights activist Martina Navratilova took FINA’s side in an interview with The Australian. “It’s been such a topsy-turvy situation…with the momentum totally on the side of the transgender athletes. When it comes to sports, biology is the biggest divider… So FINA, it’s the first big organisation that has gone all in for fairness and maybe it will try to include as many people as possible, as is fair. But fairness has to be first,” Navratilova had said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>She had also criticised the IOC for leaving the decision-making on the eligibility of transgender athletes to sports federations.</p>\n<h2>Did WA also change other rules?</h2>\n<p>DSD (Differences in Sex Development) athletes — those who have genes which are generally associated with one sex but whose reproductive organs may not be atypical — will now have to keep their testosterone below 2.5 nmol/L for 24 months to participate in the female category across events.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Earlier, DSD athletes were not required to maintain a testosterone limit unless they wanted to participate in restricted events — 400 metres to a mile. For restricted events, DSD athletes had to keep their testosterone below 5 nmol/L for six months before being eligible to participate.</p>\n</div> ",

These funds will no longer have a tax arbitrage over bank fixed deposits, where the interest income is taxed at the marginal tax rate of the individual.</p><p><strong>How have debt mutual funds been taxed until FY2022-23?</strong></p>\n<p>Until March 31, 2023, income tax laws allow taxation of these debt mutual fund schemes on the basis of a holding period.</p>\n<p>If the debt mutual fund scheme unit is redeemed on or before the completion of 36 months (3 years), then the gains on the units are called short-term capital gains. Short-term capital gains are taxed at tax rates applicable to the individual’s income.</p>\n<p>However, if the holding period exceeds 36 months, the gains are called long-term capital gains (LTCG). Long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% with an indexation benefit.</p>\n<p>Indexation means adjusting the cost of funds after taking into account <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-are-wholesale-price-index-consumer-price-index-inflation-rates-7820831/\">inflation</a> in the redemption cost. It helps to calculate the new value of investment after considering inflation over the same period.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the amendment propose?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“It is proposed to tax the income from debt mutual funds at an applicable rate since it is of the nature of interest income,” the Finance Ministry said in a note.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the benefit of indexation for calculation of LTCG on debt mutual funds will not be available for investments made on or after April 1, 2023 — in those debt mutual fund schemes where less than 35% of the total proceeds is invested in equity shares of domestic companies.</p>\n<p>These investments will now be taxed at income tax rates applicable to your income slab. This will bring investments in debt mutual funds at par with investments in bank fixed deposits.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Many feel that the removal of tax arbitrage and the creation of a consistent tax policy across all debt instruments is good news for banks looking to attract customers with higher interest rates, and to increase their borrowing and savings book sizes.</p>\n<p><strong>What will be the impact on investors?</strong></p>\n<p>Suppose you had invested Rs 2 lakh in a debt mutual fund (investing less than 35% in equities) in March 2018 and, after five years in March 2023, the value of the investment has grown to Rs 3 lakh. As per the current regime, the benefit of indexation will be applied — and your capital gains will not be Rs 1 lakh, but will be adjusted for inflation over five years.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-fed-rate-hike-indicates-what-investors-should-do-now-8515451/\">What Fed rate hike indicates, what investors should do now</a></div>\n<p>So, if the cost of index inflation rises from 100 to 125 in this period, the cost of acquisition will be treated as Rs 2.5 lakh instead of Rs 2 lakh (Rs 2 lakh x 125/100) — and your capital gains would amount to only Rs 50,000 (Rs 3 lakh minus Rs 2.5 lakh). And you will be required to pay 20% tax on Rs 50,000, which is Rs 10,000.</p>\n<p>Now, after the indexation benefit is withdrawn from April 1, 2023, if you make a similar gain over the next five years, you will have to pay tax at the marginal tax rate. The tax will be calculated on gains of Rs 1 lakh (Rs 3 lakh minus Rs 2 lakh). And if you are in the 30% tax bracket (31.2% including cess), you will be required to pay a tax of 31,200.</p>\n<p><strong>How will debt mutual funds be impacted?</strong></p>\n<p>Industry experts feel they will be dented. Niranjan Avasthi, head, product and marketing at Edelweiss AMC, said the removal of the indexation benefit from debt mutual funds is a major loss for bond markets that are still struggling with liquidity. Mutual funds are the only large active institutional investors that bring liquidity in the bond market.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Manish P Hingar, founder of Fintoo, a financial advisory firm, said this could result in investors seeking out other options. It may have a negative impact on all debt funds, particularly in the retail category, as ultra-high net worth and high net worth individuals may choose to invest in safe havens like bank fixed deposits.</p>\n<p><strong>So does this make FDs more attractive?</strong></p>\n<p>Not necessarily. Some experts said debt funds will still hold an advantage over FDs because of their active fund management and capital gains on account of trading in the bond market. While conservative investors may be more comfortable with a bank FD as deposits of up to Rs 5 lakh are insured, savvier investors may opt for debt mutual funds. Debt mutual funds may also carry some risk on account of the riskiness of the bond papers they subscribe to.</p>\n<p><strong>How have AMCs stocks reacted?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The proposed changes saw an immediate impact on the share prices of mutual funds. While the share price of HDFC AMC fell 4.21% on Friday, the share price of UTI AMC and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC were down by 4.77% and 4.44% respectively.</p>\n</div> ",

A notification issued by the Lok Sabha Secretariat on Friday said Rahul “stands disqualified from the membership of Lok Sabha from the date of his conviction i.e. 23 March, 2023 in terms of the provisions of Article 102(1)(e) of the Constitution of India read with Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951”.</p><div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"5.3173198482933\" morss_score=\"77.60422043308861\">\n<p>A copy of the notification was forwarded to “Shri Rahul Gandhi, Ex-MP”.</p><span><img src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/opposition-leaders-protest-3col.jpg?resize=416,600\"> Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge with leaders of other Opposition parties during a protest in New Delhi on Friday. Anil Sharma</span>\n<h2>Why has the Lok Sabha Secretariat issued this notification?</h2>\n<p>It is part of the procedure. In a note on October 13, 2015, the Election Commission of India had asked state chief secretaries to issue appropriate instructions to the department dealing with prosecutions to ensure that cases of conviction of sitting MPs or MLAs were brought to the notice of the Speaker or Chairman of the House, and to the Chief Electoral Officer of the state, along with the order of conviction within seven days of the order.</p>\n<p>Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 states that “a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release.”</p>\n<p>Thus, the disqualification is triggered by the conviction itself, and not by the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/\">Lok Sabha</a> notification. The notification is merely a formal notice to Rahul, who was in Lok Sabha on Friday before the House was adjourned.</p>\n<p>In the case of a disqualified MLA, the notice is issued by the Vidhan Sabha concerned. For example, in the case of <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/samajwadi-party/\">Samajwadi Party</a> MLA Azam Khan, the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly Secretariat issued the notice of disqualification in October last year.</p>\n<h2>Is the authority of the Speaker final in this regard?</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court in its ruling in Lok Prahari v Union of India (2018) clarified that a disqualification triggered by a conviction will be reversed if the conviction is stayed by a court. “Once the conviction has been stayed during the pendency of an appeal, the disqualification which operates as a consequence of the conviction cannot take or remain in effect,” the ruling said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The notification by the House Secretariat regarding Rahul will cease to be in effect if and when his conviction is stayed.</p>\n<h2>What are Article 102(1)(e) of the Constitution and Section 8 of the RP Act?</h2>\n<p>Article 102 of the Constitution deals with grounds for disqualification of a parliamentarian.</p>\n<p>Sub-clause (e) of Article 102(1) says an MP will lose his membership of the House “if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament”. The law in this case is the RP Act.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Section 8 of the RP Act deals with disqualification of a lawmaker for conviction in certain offences. The provision is aimed at “preventing criminalisation of politics and keeping ‘tainted’ lawmakers from contesting elections.</p>\n<h2>What does Rahul lose along with his membership of Lok Sabha?</h2>\n<p>As a Lok Sabha MP, Rahul was entitled to a house in Lutyens’ <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a>. Following his disqualification, he will have one month to vacate his 12 Tughlak Lane home, according to sources in the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry. Rahul had been allotted the house after being elected MP from Amethi in 2004.</p>\n<p>The Lok Sabha Secretariat has sent a copy of the disqualification notification to the liaison officer of the Directorate of Estates for further action. The sources said since the bungalow belongs to the Lok Sabha pool of residential properties, the action for its vacation would have to be initiated by the Lok Sabha Secretariat.</p>\n<p>Rahul also loses all other perks that a Member of Parliament enjoys.</p>\n<h2>When do the people of Wayanad get a representative back in Lok Sabha?</h2>\n<p>The Election Commission can announce a byelection to the seat — in Azam Khan’s case, the schedule for the byelection to Khan’s 37-Rampur seat (along with byelections to fill four other vacancies across the country) was announced within a few days.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>However, in the more recent case of Lakshadweep MP P P Mohammed Faisal, the EC, which had announced the bypoll on January 18 after the MP’s conviction, had to withdraw the announcement on January 30 after Faisal’s conviction was suspended by the Kerala High Court on January 25.</p>\n<h2>What options are available to Rahul Gandhi here onward?</h2>\n<p>His disqualification can be reversed if a higher court grants a stay on the conviction or decides the appeal in his favour. His first appeal would have to be before the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/surat/\">Surat</a> Sessions Court, and then before the Gujarat High Court.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>If he does not get relief from the courts, he will be disqualified from contesting elections for eight years — two years of his sentence, plus six years under the provisions of the RP Act.</p>\n<p>His lawyer Kirit Panwala moved an application before the Surat court on Friday seeking time to file an appeal.</p>\n</div> </div>\n",

The conviction triggered the process of his disqualification as a lawmaker.</p>\n<h2>What is Article 102 of the Indian Constitution?</h2>\n<p>Article 102 deals with the disqualification of MPs from either house of the Parliament.</p>\n<p>Part (1) of the article lists the reasons why an MP can be disqualified. These include, “(a) if he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, other than an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder; (b) if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court; (c) if he is an undischarged insolvent; (d) if he is not a citizen of India, or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State, or is under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a foreign State; (e) if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament.”</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a>’s case, the last point (if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament) applies. The law under which he has been disqualified is the Representation of People Act, 1951.</p>\n<h2>What is the Representation of People Act, 1951?</h2>\n<p>The Representation of the People Act, 1951 is an act of Parliament of India to provide for the conduct of election of the Houses of Parliament and to the House or Houses of the Legislature of each State, the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of those Houses, the corrupt practices and other offences at or in connection with such elections and the decision of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with such elections.

While Netanyahu and his allies believe these changes are necessary to limit the Supreme Court’s “overreach”, opponents have claimed that they would undermine judicial independence and encourage authoritarianism.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the new law?</strong></p>\n<p>The latest legislature stipulates that only the Prime Minister themselves or the cabinet, with a two-thirds majority, can declare the leader unfit to hold office on physical or mental grounds. This stands in contrast to the older rule regarding removing a sitting Prime Minister that “lacked details on circumstances that may give rise to such situations”, Reuters mentioned in a recent report.</p>\n<p>A statement released by the Knesset said, “the authority to declare the Prime Minister incapacitated will only belong to the government or the Knesset and will only occur due to physical or mental incapacity.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>It further added that, as per the new law, the Supreme Court can’t consider “a request to declare the incapacity of the Prime Minister.”</p>\n<p>“Given that a sitting Prime Minister derives his power and authority from the people through his representatives, this proposal reflects the existing concept according to which the removal of the leader against his will, will be determined by the people’s representatives alone without the involvement of an unelected arm,” the statement said, CNN reported.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the criticism against the new law?</strong></p>\n<p>The passing of the latest legislature has come not much after Gali Baharav-Miara, Israel’s attorney-general, ordered Netanyahu to not get involved in his government’s judicial overhaul due to a conflict of interest arising from his corruption trial. The Prime Minister is currently facing charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three cases.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>His opponents believe that the law has been enacted so that neither Baharav-Miara nor the Supreme Court can declare Netanyahu unfit to hold office.</p>\n<p>“Like thieves in the night, the coalition just passed a disgraceful and corrupt personalised law in response to a baseless rumour about recusal. Every citizen of Israel should know – days before Passover, while the cost of living is soaring, Netanyahu is once more looking out only for himself,” Lapid said on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s supporters such as Ofir Katz, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, have claimed that the legislature would bring “stability” by making it harder to remove a Prime Minister against their will, the BBC reported.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the cases against Netanyahu?</strong></p>\n<p>The corruption trial against Netanyahu consists of the so-called Case 1000, Case 2000 and Case 4000.</p>\n<p>Case 1000 pertains to the charge of fraud and breach of trust for gifts worth over $280,000 that Netanyahu and his wife Sara received from Oscar-nominated Israeli-American Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan (‘L.A. Confidential’, ‘The Revenant’, ‘Birdman’, ’12 Years a Slave’, ‘Mr &amp; Mrs Smith’, ‘Fight Club’) and Australian businessman James Packer (the son of Kerry Packer, the founder of World Series Cricket), in return for political favours between 2007 and 2016. Netanyahu hasn’t denied accepting these gifts. His defence maintains that it is acceptable to receive gifts from friends.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Case 2000 is about a charge of fraud and breach of trust for a deal that Netanyahu struck before the 2015 elections with Arnon ‘Noni’ Mozes, owner of the Hebrew-language Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel’s largest selling daily newspaper, for favourable coverage in return for legislation to damage the rival daily newspaper Israel Hayom. This deal was never finalised.</p>\n<p>Case 4000 constitutes the most serious charges against Netanyahu, of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu is alleged to have granted regulatory favours worth over $500 million to Israel’s largest telecommunications company Bezeq Telecom between 2012-2017, in return for favourable coverage.</p>\n</div> ",

It is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel (1802-29), who in his short life made pioneering contributions in a multitude of fields. It is often considered to be an equivalent of the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/nobel-season-is-here-5-things-to-know-about-the-prizes-8187120/\"><strong>Nobel prize</strong> </a>– <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-is-there-no-mathematics-nobel-the-theories-the-facts-the-myths-6071015/\">which does not have a category for mathematics</a> </strong>– and has been modelled as such.</p><p>The prize includes a monetary award of 7.5 million kroner (roughly $ 720,000) and a glass plaque designed by Norwegian artist Henrik Haugan. It is awarded by The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, on behalf of the Ministry of Education.</p>\n<h2>Who is Luis Caffarelli and why did he win the Abel prize?</h2>\n<p>Caffarelli was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, making him the first Abel laureate from South America. Currently, he is a professor at the University of Texas, Austin. He is married to fellow Argentinian mathematician Irene Martínez Gamba, who teaches at UT, Austin as well.</p>\n<p>Cafarelli has been one of the leading figures in the study of partial differential equations for over five decades. According to his Abel citation, “Partial differential equations arise naturally as laws of nature, whether to describe the flow of water or the growth of populations. These equations have been a constant source of intense study since the days of Newton and Leibniz.”</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/in-abel-prize-triumph-a-statement-against-gender-gap-in-mathematics-5640709/\">In Abel Prize triumph, a statement against gender gap in mathematics</a></div>\n<p>The Abel citation states that Caffarelli has made “groundbreaking contributions” that have “radically changed our understanding of classes of nonlinear partial differential equations with wide applications. The results are technically virtuous, covering many different areas of mathematics and its applications.” Notably, he has been recognised for “combining brilliant geometric insight with ingenious analytical tools and methods” in this field of mathematics.</p>\n<p>“Mathematics is like a Swiss army knife: the same tool can be applied to many different problems. The tools that Caffarelli has come up with have been applied to many different problems, from equations describing nature to financial mathematics”, Helge Holden, the chair of the Abel committee, told <em>The Guardian</em>.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What is the Abel Prize?</h2>\n<p>The prize was established by the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget) in 2002, marking the 200th anniversary of Niels Henrick Abel’s birth. Notably, the prize was first proposed in 1899, when Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie proposed establishing a prize named after Abel when he learned that Alfred Nobel’s plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. This plan never materialised.</p>\n<p>In 2001, as Abel’s 200th birth anniversary drew close, a working group was formed to develop a proposal for such a prize. This group presented a proposal to the Norwegian prime minister, who soon announced the creation of the Abel prize.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/history-oscar-trophy-value-origins-story-explained-8493450/\">What is the history behind the golden Oscars trophy and why is it only worth $1?</a></div>\n<p>The Abel Prize is awarded and administered by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters on behalf of the Norwegian government. It is financed by the Norwegian government which also does not tax the prize money. The recipients are chosen by the Abel Committee, which comprises expert mathematicians, all appointed by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, under the advice of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) and the European Mathematical Society (EMS).</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Who was Niels Henrick Abel?</h2>\n<p>Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) was a Norwegian mathematician who left a big impact on a number of fields in his rather short life. His most famous single result is the first complete proof demonstrating the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation in radicals. This question was one of the outstanding open problems of his day, and had been unresolved for over 250 years.</p>\n<p>He was also an innovator in the field of elliptic functions, discoverer of what would later be known as Abelian functions. He made all his discoveries while living in crippling poverty. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 26.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the richness of Abel’s work in his shirt lifespan, French mathematician Charles Hermite once said, “ Abel has left mathematicians enough to keep them busy for five hundred years.”</p>\n</div> ",

Though it was de-silted in 2017, it started receiving untreated sewage. In early March this year, residents living in the vicinity of the lake saw BBMP trucks dumping huge mounds of mud into it.</p>\n<span><img src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/IMG-20230320-WA0065.jpg?resize=600,450\"> The 25 feet-wide mud road on the Hosakerehalli lake in Bengaluru. (Express Photo)</span>\n<p>On March 21, wildlife conservationist Joseph Hoover posted videos on social media that a 25 feet-wide road has been constructed on the lake utilising the mud.</p>\n<p>In response to the questions posed by the local residents, Shilpa, BBMP executive engineer (lakes), said that she was not aware of such works. However, with mounting pressure, on March 21 the BBMP put a flex banner outside the lake’s boundary.</p>\n<p>It stated, “From Hosakerehalli lake no permanent road will be constructed inside the lake. Only a temporary mound of mud is laid so that tippers and machinery could move to remove silt. After removal of silt, the temporary mound of mud will be removed (sic),” adding that the road had to do with work regarding the rejuvenation of the lake.</p>\n<h2>Why did the BBMP build a mud road?</h2>\n<p>On March 23, senior officials from BBMP, including special commissioner (project) Ravindra PN, visited the lake. Ravindra said that he would direct the officials to remove the temporary road.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“I was not aware of the formation of a temporary road on the lake.

An SWD is meant to receive water from rains and direct it in a channelised manner away from roads to prevent waterlogging and flooding. But at times, due to improper management of waste, these drains become clogged. Encroachment of areas around them also leads to the dumping of waste in SWDs and the water bodies into which they discharge rainwater.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Lakes of Bengaluru</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/lakes-of-bengaluru-pristine-environment-hosakerehalli-lake-cries-rejuvenation-8047708/\">Once a symbol of pristine environment, Hosakerehalli lake cries for rejuvenation</a></div>\n<p>Issues of encroachment and improper dumping of waste have been flagged in other areas of the city, too. In 2022, the Karnataka High Court stated that the flooding that had happened in parts of Bengaluru in September was a <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-flooding-storm-water-drain-encroachment-karnataka-high-court-8147708/\">result of the municipal corporation’s failure</a></strong> to remove encroachments from waterbodies and storm-water drainage systems. The HC ordered the Karnataka government and the BBMP to take immediate steps.</p>\n<p>Out of the total extent of Hosakerehalli lake, six acres have been encroached on by a private body and 0.26 acres have been encroached on by the government.</p>\n<p>Local residents claim that the lake’s condition has worsened in the last three years.</p>\n<p>“The waste collected from houses and poultries is dumped in the lake. Even the medicinal waste is dumped here. The untreated sewage from Sapthagiri layout enters the lake. The borewells have been dug on the lake bed. The funds which are released in the name of funding to restore the lake are not being utilised. In the past we had approached the BBMP to deploy marshals (security personnel of the BBMP) at the lake so that nobody dumps garbage but even this did not happen,” said lake activist Ram Kumar BK.</p>\n<p>In December 2022, 10 trees on the banks of Hosakerehalli Lake were felled without seeking the permission of the BBMP forest department. It was then speculated by environmentalists that a road would be constructed to facilitate access to a luxury apartment complex in the vicinity. Officials from the BBMP forest cell stated that the trees were chopped without their permission and they were not aware of the reason behind the felling of trees.</p>\n</div> ",

It was passed late Tuesday night following seven hours of discussions, amendments, and calls for a life sentence, NYT reported.</p><h2><strong>What are the punishments under the Bill?</strong></h2>\n<p>The Bill states that anyone who “tries” to have same-sex relations will face seven years of imprisonment. It goes so far as to prohibit even touching another person “with the intention of committing the act of homosexuality.” People found guilty of the “offense of homosexuality”, can be imprisoned for up to 10 years. “It also effectively declares all same-sex conduct as nonconsensual,” Human Rights Watch (HRW) has reported.</p>\n<p>The crime of “aggravated homosexuality” is defined as homosexual acts committed by an HIV-infected person, involving children or disabled persons, or against anyone in an inebriated state who is incapable of giving informed consent. “Aggravated homosexuality” is punishable with the death penalty. Before this Bill, Uganda’s Penal Code recognised most of these acts as crimes, but never accorded the death penalty for the same.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/uganda-law-lgbtq-rights-africa-india-rest-of-the-world-8512622/\">Uganda makes it a crime to identify as LGBTQ: What’s the status of gay rights elsewhere</a></div>\n<p>Further, any entity, including media groups, journalists, and publishers, can be convicted of promoting homosexuality and will have to face up to five years imprisonment and/ or pay a fine of up to 1 billion Ugandan shillings, which comes to around Rs 21,851. “Promotions” will include publishing, distributing, and broadcasting content advocating for gay rights.</p>\n<p>The Bill also punishes minors convicted of engaging in same-sex acts with up to three years’ imprisonment and a period of “rehabilitation”. Besides this, it punishes individuals convicted of trafficking children or grooming them to engage in same-sex acts with life imprisonment.</p>\n<p>Even a property owner whose premises are used as a “brothel for homosexual acts” or any other LGBTQ rights activities can face the risk of getting arrested, BBC has reported. According to Human Rights Watch, a provision in the Bill outlaws providing accommodation that facilitates the “offense of homosexuality.” For example, if anyone were to rent a room to a gay couple, they could go to jail for ten years. Similarly, if anyone conducts or officiates a same-sex marriage ceremony, they can be imprisoned for ten years.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Moreover, the Bill has a mandatory reporting provision that makes it illegal to identify as LGBTQ, something unprecedented even for Uganda. This provision requires friends, family, and community members of those engaging in same-sex relationships to report them to the authorities. This mandatory reporting provision calls for a fine or six months imprisonment.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the objective of this Bill?</strong></h2>\n<p>Speaker of Uganda’s Parliament, Anita Annet Among, has told the NYT that the House will continue passing laws to “recognise, protect and safeguard” the morals and culture of their country.</p>\n<p>This Bill was introduced on March 9, by Ugandan legislator Asuman Basalirwa, who claimed that homosexuality threatened the safety of Uganda’s children and its family values. “The objective of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2023 is to establish comprehensive and enhanced legislation to protect traditional family values, our diverse culture, and faiths by prohibiting any form of sexual relations between people of the same sex &amp; promoting it,” Basalirwa tweeted on Tuesday.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2><strong>What is the current status of the Bill?</strong></h2>\n<p>Following its passage in Parliament, the Bill will now be sent to Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni, who has been severely critical of homosexuality and has accused gays of undermining Uganda’s stability. Recently he referred to homosexuals as “deviants”.</p>\n<p>President Museveni, who has been in power for four decades, can either use his veto power over the law or sign it into law within 30 days. However, his history of anti-gay remarks indicate what course he will take.</p>\n<p>While the Bill hasn’t officially been published, a majority of its elements were discussed in Parliament.</p>\n<div><span>Explained Global </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/blood-donation-gay-transgender-people-ban-global-rules-8495750/\">Blood donation by gay, transgender people: Why was the ban imposed?

The White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has warned Uganda of possible sanctions, restricting lawmakers responsible for passing the anti-LGBTQ Bill from doing business with the US, the Independent reported.</p>\n<p>Moreover, an anonymous Uganda-based source has told the BBC that, “Members of the queer community have been blackmailed, extorted for money or even lured into traps for mob attacks. In some areas, law enforcers are using the current environment to extort money from people who they accuse of being gay. Even some families are reporting their children to the police.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>This Bill is not the first of its kind, as Uganda tried to introduce a similar version of it by way of its 2014 Anti-Homosexuality Act.</p>\n<h2><strong>What was the 2014 Anti-Homosexuality Act?</strong></h2>\n<p>The current Bill is a “revised and more egregious version of the 2014 Anti-Homosexuality Act”, HRW has said. In 2014, Uganda passed a Bill reinforcing existing prison sentences under the Penal Code for same-sex conduct and outlawed the “promotion of homosexuality.” However, in August 2014, the country’s constitutional court struck down this Act as “null and void”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n\n<p>In doing so, a panel of five judges had ruled that the Speaker of parliament acted illegally when she allowed a vote on the measure despite at least three objections to the fact that the required number of MPs were not in attendance. “The speaker was obliged to ensure that there was quorum,” the court said in its ruling, as reported by The Guardian.</p>\n<h2><strong>What was Uganda’s legal position on homosexuality before the Bill?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to HRW, Uganda’s penal code already punishes “carnal knowledge against the order of nature,” which is interpreted as homosexual relations, with a punishment of life imprisonment. However, this provision is seen as a “colonial remnant” and is “rarely enforced”, which is why the lawmakers are pushing for its revision in line with the modern situation.</p>\n<p>The revised version of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill comes after months of “hostile rhetoric against sexual and gender minorities by public figures in Uganda” along with government crackdowns on LGBTQ rights and human rights groups.</p>\n<p>Uganda’s National Bureau for NGOs banned Sexual Minorities  Uganda (SMUG), a prominent LGBTQ rights organisation, for not having officially registered with it, in August 2022. In January, this year the bureau identified 26 NGOs that promote homosexuality and recommended banning their operations.</p>\n<p>On February 5, Major Gen. Francis Takirwa, Deputy Commander in the Ugandan military called to exclude gay people from receiving health services, saying, “Don’t use our health facilities to treat homosexuals.” This was followed by Uganda’s Sports Minister calling for the introduction of capital punishment for same-sex conduct.</p>\n<p>Before this, in 2021, Uganda’s Parliament approved the Sexual Offenses Bill, which criminalized any “sexual act between persons of the same gender,” and anal sex between people of any gender, with up to 10 years in prison. However, President Yoweri Museveni had rejected this Bill and returned it to Parliament, due to the offenses already being covered under Uganda’s penal code.</p>\n</div> ",

Disregarding opposition from lawmakers from both parties and from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Deterring America’s Technological Adversaries (DATA) Bill was passed in the US Congress on February 24, just a few days before the White House “guidance” was released.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the DATA Act of 2023, also called the Warner Bill – named after Democrat Senator Mark Warner of Virginia – formally facilitates government agencies to “deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise mitigate” services they deem threatening, as long as they have access to “sensitive personal data” from more than 1 million people in the US.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In other words, though DATA does not explicitly name TikTok, it empowers the secretary of Commerce to ban foreign technologies and companies from operating in the US if they present a threat to national security. “Today, the threat that everyone is talking about is TikTok, and how it could enable surveillance by the Chinese Communist Party,” Warner told the media on the day the Bill was passed.</p>\n<h2>So who exactly owns TikTok?</h2>\n<p>At another level, giving a new twist to the ongoing fight between the US and China to wrest control of TikTok, an article in FTChinese.com last Thursday raises doubts about the company being owned by China. “TikTok’s encounter with the US government is not only related to the rights and interests of the parent company ByteDance but greatly concerns its majority foreign shareholders,” the article in Chinese claims.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/china-protests-zero-covid-xi-jinping-explained-8299359/\">Reading China’s ‘Zero-Covid’ and anti-Xi Jinping protests</a></div>\n<p>Citing a statement issued by ByteDance, the article further said its foreign investors own about 60% of the shares and the remaining 40% of shares are equally divided between its employees and company founders, respectively.</p>\n<p>Yang Fangxi, the article’s author, a management graduate educated and trained in the US, is an expert in planning communication strategies, public opinion, and public policy and is widely respected in both mainland China and the United States. Yang writes in the article that the US has politicised the ownership of ByteDance’s “political gene.” “From the perspective of equity structure business operations can ByteDance even be considered a Chinese company?” Yang asks.</p>\n<p>ByteDance’s majority foreign shareholders include high-profile investment companies such as Coatue Management, General Atlantic, Susquehanna International Group, and Sequoia Capital.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Furthermore, most of these well-known companies have rich experience and have been doing business in China for long. For example, since the year 2000, General Atlantic has had a total investment of $6.7 billion in China and is invested in 34 companies. Coatue, on the other hand, led a round of investment in Heytea, a local Chinese consumer brand.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the four foreign companies also serve as members on the board of ByteDance, and ByteDance too occupies a considerable share of their investment in China. Back in America, the CEOs of these companies are politically well-connected and they actually actively lobbied for TikTok in 2019 when the Trump administration called for TikTok’s ban and disinvestment.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>And how does this play into US-China ties?</h2>\n<p>As mentioned, TikTok is the most popular social media app in the US and almost half the number of Americans are its active users. The app is also the world’s most popular short video-sharing app and has over 1 billion active users worldwide. It is expected to generate $10 billion in revenue globally – in America alone its advertisement revenue is likely to exceed $2.7 billion. Following the skirmishes on the India-China border in the remote Himalayas in 2020, the app along with WeChat and other Chinese digital apps was banned by the government in India.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, just hours before Singapore-born TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, was to make a high-profile appearance before the US House Committee on Commerce and Energy on Thursday to challenge the potential ban on and oppose the forced sale of TikTok, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson has said, “If the news [of the ban on TikTok] is true, China will resolutely oppose it.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Last Tuesday, Shou took to Instagram and posted a video recording urging its 150 million American users to tell the House Representatives “what they love about TikTok.” Clad in casual jeans and seen grinning in the video message, Shou said banning the app could take TikTok away from all its 150 million users.</p>\n<p>Following tensions across the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-china-problem-nancy-pelosi-visit-taiwan-8066503/\">Taiwan</a> Strait, the more recent “spy balloon” controversy, and frequent accusations by the US that China is supplying lethal weapons to Russia in the war against <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/russia-invasion-ukraine-history-creation-explained-7791147/\">Ukraine</a>, the potential banning of TikTok has emerged as one focus of conflicts between China and Western governments over technology and security that are disrupting processor chip, smartphones and other industries.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, it would be interesting to wait and see how the world markets and tech industries react to what action the authorities in Beijing resort to “if the US actually bans TikTok.”</p>\n<p><em><strong>Dr Hemant Adlakha teaches Chinese at JNU, and is Vice-Chairperson and Honorary Fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a>. </strong></em></p>\n</div> ",

On Thursday, the <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/business/uk-central-bank-hikes-rates-like-fed-amid-financial-turmoil-8514983/\">Bank of England raised the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point</a></strong>, its eleventh consecutive increase in the cost of borrowing since December 2021.</p><p>Experts said that the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-fed-and-what-role-does-it-play-us-economy-7824639/\">Fed</a>’s decision indicates more rate hikes by the RBI going forward and, therefore, further increases in EMIs and deposit rates, and subdued equity market returns for now.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/credit-suisse-ubs-bank-collapse-us-fed-8507215/\">Credit Suisse sold to UBS: Why are banks in turmoil across the world</a></div>\n<h2><strong>What does the Fed’s hike indicate?</strong></h2>\n<p>According to IFA Global, the hike was expected — as a pause would have indicated a lack of confidence in the measures taken to address the troubles in the banking system.</p>\n<p>The policy statement said the Fed remains committed to achieving its <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-are-wholesale-price-index-consumer-price-index-inflation-rates-7820831/\">inflation</a> mandate. It has followed the same playbook as the European Central Bank (ECB): separating its financial stability mandate from the price stability mandate.</p>\n<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell also indicated that even higher interest rates could be coming as inflation remained hotter than expected. Fed officials expect at least one more rate hike this year, according to projections released on Wednesday. “If we need to raise rates higher, we will,” Powell said.</p>\n<p>He said the financial sector was “sound and resilient”. There had been speculation that the Fed might go slow on rate hikes and follow a loose monetary policy to bring the banking system back on the rails, as analysts had blamed the flurry of rate hikes in the last 10 months for the banking crisis.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2><strong>Will the RBI hike as well?</strong></h2>\n<p>When the Fed is tightening, interest rates tend to rise more for emerging markets, including India, which see a sharp currency depreciation. “Fed action is due to large excess demand, tight labour markets and an unprecedented deviation from the inflation target. India does not have these conditions and has the space not to follow the Fed. It also started from higher nominal policy rates,” Ashima Goyal, Member, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-rbi-mpc-and-what-does-it-do-7801244/\">Monetary Policy Committee</a> of the RBI, said in the minutes of the policy meeting discussions.</p>\n<p>While it is not necessary that the RBI will blindly follow the Fed and other central banks in hiking rates, interest rates in India have, in fact, moved in tandem with rates in the US. While most central banks, including the RBI, have been raising rates to tame inflation, the RBI considers domestic factors, especially retail inflation, while reviewing interest rates. As price pressures wane, several central banks have opted for slower rate hikes or pauses.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/how-safe-is-your-money-amid-global-bank-crises-8502097/\">How safe is your money amid global bank crises</a></div>\n<p>After the 250 bps hike in the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/everyday-economics-rbi-repo-reverse-repo-rates-7776942/\">repo rate</a> to 6.50% over the last 10 months, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will meet on April 3-6 to decide its strategy.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“With the headline CPI print tracking above 6% mark for January and February, we build in an additional rate hike of 25 bps by the RBI in its April policy review, as we peg the terminal rate at 6.75%. Further, in our view, the inflation trajectory is likely to decelerate from QE June, which will preempt the RBI to pause the rate hike cycle,” Morgan Stanley said in a report.</p>\n<p>However, Nomura expects the RBI to remain on hold in April owing to the benign forward inflation profile, lagged monetary policy effects, worsening US financial/ economic outlooks and weaker domestic demand outlook in FY24. “We assign a higher probability to a pause (80%) than to a 25 bps hike (20%),” Nomura said.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does the Fed hike mean for investors?</strong></h2>\n<p>When interest rates rise in the US and other developed markets, foreign investors, especially from the US, go for investments in US debt and other avenues, which impacts the flow of funds into Indian equity markets. Since the beginning of January 2023, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have pulled out a net of more than Rs 27,000 crore from Indian equities.</p>\n<p>“While the rising interest rates represent a headwind for Indian equities, our buoyant domestic demand scenario presents hope for global investors looking to diversify globally. We remain constructive on Indian equities over the medium term and continue to orient our portfolios around domestic cyclical which continue to look attractive in the medium term,” a fund manager said.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, FPI flows saw bouts of revival but the momentum has flagged amidst a domestic stock market rout, exacerbated by the Fed’s fight against inflation, and the reopening in China. FPI flows are important to India as they help to meet funding requirements caused by a growing <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/explained-what-current-account-deficit-widened-q3-last-fy-7848400/\">current account deficit</a>, says a Bank of Baroda report.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“Since risk off is the dominant market mood following the bank failures in the US and fears of contagion, FPIs are unlikely to turn buyers in the near term,” V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said.</p>\n<p>As for debt investors, as interest rates are expected to rise further before stabilising and moving on a downward trajectory, investment advisors say they should look to invest in medium- to long-term debt investment products as interest rates peak in the coming months.</p>\n</div> ",

Reporting of TB cases also improved in 2021 – although it didn’t reach the pre-pandemic levels, it bounced back from the lows seen during the first year of the pandemic, according to the Global TB Report 2022.</p>\n<p>The incidence of TB – new cases detected through the year – reduced by 18% in 2021 over the 2015 baseline, dropping to 210 cases per lakh population as compared to 256 cases per lakh population. The incidence of drug-resistant TB also went down by 20% during the period from 1.49 lakh cases in 2015 to 1.19 lakh cases in 2021.</p>\n<p>India accounts for 28% of all TB cases in the world, according to the Global TB Report 2022. There were 21.3 lakh cases detected in 2021 as compared to 18.05 lakh cases in 2020. The numbers are still lower than the 24.04 lakh cases reported before the pandemic in 2019, according to data from the government’s Ni-kshay portal that can help in real-time reporting of new TB cases.</p>\n<p>A survey conducted across 20 states pegged the incidence at a higher 312 cases per lakh population.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>What is India’s TB elimination target?</strong></h2>\n<p>Although elimination of Tuberculosis is one of the sustainable development targets to be achieved by 2030 by the world, India has set the target of 2025. The national strategic plan 2017-2025 sets the target of India reporting no more than 44 new TB cases or 65 total cases per lakh population by 2025. The estimated TB incidence for the year 2021 stood at 210 per lakh population.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Achieving this target is a big task as the plan had envisaged an incidence of only 77 cases per lakh population by 2023.</p>\n<p>The programme also aims to reduce the mortality to 3 deaths per lakh population by 2025. The estimated TB mortality for the year 2020 stood at 37 per lakh population.</p>\n<p>The plan also aims to reduce catastrophic costs for the affected family to zero. However, the report states that 7 to 32 per cent of those with drug-sensitive TB, and 68 per cent with drug-resistant TB experienced catastrophic costs.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The goals are in line with the World Health Organisation’s End TB strategy that calls for 80% reduction in the number of new cases, 90% reduction in mortality, and zero catastrophic cost by 2030.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is being done to try to achieve this target?</strong></h2>\n<p>To achieve the TB elimination target of 2025, the government has taken several steps including looking for cases actively among vulnerable and co-morbid populations, screening for it at the health and wellness centres, and calling on the private sector to notify all TB cases.</p>\n<p>An online Ni-kshay portal has been set up to track the notified TB cases.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has led to improved access to the more accurate molecular diagnostic tests like CB-NAAT and TureNat that were also used to test for <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/\">Covid-19</a>. At present, there are 4,760 molecular diagnostic machines available, covering all districts of the country. In addition, 79 line probe assay laboratories and 96 liquid culture testing laboratories have been set up for the diagnosis of multi and extremely drug resistant TB.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-health/statins-new-pill-nexletol-cuts-cholesterol-heart-attacks-explained-8480455/\">Can’t take statins? New pill ‘Nexletol’ cuts cholesterol, heart attacks: Here’s how</a></div>\n<p>The government has also implemented a universal drug susceptibility test, meaning that antibiotic susceptibility of the mycobacterium is determined for all newly diagnosed cases. Earlier, the patients were started on first line treatment and were tested for drug resistance only if the therapy did not work. Conducting a drug susceptibility test at the outset ensures that the patients are given antibiotics that will work for them from the get go.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Last year, the government also launched the community engagement programme where Ni-kshay mitras can adopt TB patients and provide them monthly nutritional support. So far, 71,460 Ni-kshay Mitras have adopted about 10 lakh TB patients under the programme.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the improvements in treatment protocols?</strong></h2>\n<p>Newer drugs such as Bedaquiline and Delamanid for the treatment of drug-resistant TB have been included in the government’s basket of drugs provided free TB patients. These oral drugs can replace the injectable kanamycin that was associated with serious side effects like kidney problems and deafness.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>These new drugs have also been included in the new National List of Essential Medicines that gives the government power to regulate their market price as well.</p>\n<p>Researchers have also been studying shorter three- and four-month courses of anti-tubercular drugs, instead of the existing six-month therapy. Anti-tubercular drugs have to be taken for six months to over two years depending on the susceptibility of the mycobacterium. Long duration of treatment results in people dropping out in between, increasing their likelihood of them developing drug-resistant infections later.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2><strong>Are there newer vaccines in the pipeline?</strong></h2>\n<p>Nearly 100 years after the existing BCG vaccine was developed, researchers are on the lookout for newer ways of preventing tuberculosis infection. The BCG vaccine uses a weakened form of the TB bacteria to train the immune system. Although it can protect against severe forms of TB like the ones in the brain, the protection is not very good against the most common form of TB in the lungs.</p>\n<p>It offers limited protection to adults, it doesn’t prevent people from getting the infection or re-activation of a latent infection.</p>\n<p>Trials are underway to test the effectiveness of a vaccine called Immuvac, which was initially developed to prevent leprosy, in preventing TB. The vaccine developed using mycobacterium indicus pranii has antigens – the portions of a pathogen against which antibodies are developed – similar to those of leprosy and TB bacteria.</p>\n<p>Researchers are also testing the vaccine candidate called VPM1002, which is a recombinant form of the BCG vaccine modified to express the TB antigens better. This results in better training of the immune system and protection against TB.</p>\n<p>Researchers are also studying whether the existing BCG vaccine booster shot should be given to household contacts of a person with active tuberculosis.</p>\n</div> ",

What is the ruling and how does the disqualification operate?</p><h2>What did the Surat Court rule?</h2>\n<p>Chief Judicial Magistrate HH Verma convicted Gandhi in a 2019 defamation case, for saying ‘why do all thieves have the name Modi’, and sentenced him to two years in prison. The remarks were made during a rally in Kolar, Karnataka, in the run-up to the 2019 <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/\">Lok Sabha</a> elections. “Why do all thieves, be it <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-is-nirav-modi-punjab-national-bank-fraud-case-5064606/\">Nirav Modi</a>, Lalit Modi or <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a>, have Modi in their names,” Gandhi had said in Hindi.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/gujarat-court-rahul-gandhi-defamation-case-explained-8514062/\">Gujarat court finds Rahul Gandhi guilty: What is the 2019 defamation case against him?</a></div>\n<p>Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) prescribes for defamation a simple imprisonment for a “term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.”</p>\n<p>The court also approved Gandhi’s bail on a surety of Rs 15,000 and suspended the sentence for 30 days to allow him to appeal.</p>\n<h2>Why does Gandhi face disqualification?</h2>\n<p>Disqualification of a lawmaker is prescribed in three situations. First is through the Articles 102(1) and 191(1) for disqualification of a member of Parliament and a member of the Legislative Assembly respectively. The grounds here include holding an office of profit, being of unsound mind or insolvent or not having valid citizenship.</p>\n<p>The second prescription of disqualification is in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, which provides for the disqualification of the members on grounds of defection.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The third prescription is under The Representation of The People Act (RPA), 1951. This law provides for disqualification for conviction in criminal cases.</p>\n<h2>What does the RPA say?</h2>\n<p>There are several provisions that deal with disqualification under the RPA. Section 9 deals with disqualification for dismissal for corruption or disloyalty, and for entering into government contracts while being a lawmaker. Section 10 deals with disqualification for failure to lodge an account of election expenses. A key provision, Section 11, deals with disqualification for corrupt practices.</p>\n<p>Section 8 of the RPA deals with disqualification for conviction of offences. The provision is aimed at “preventing criminalisation of politics” and keeping ‘tainted’ lawmakers from contesting elections.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-the-lily-thomas-rahul-gandhi-8515037/\">What is the Lily Thomas SC verdict, which affects Rahul Gandhi’s disqualification case</a></div>\n<p>First, disqualification is triggered for conviction under certain offences listed in Section 8(1) of The Representation of The People Act. This includes specific offences such as promoting enmity between two groups, bribery, and undue influence or personation at an election. Senior <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/samajwadi-party/\">Samajwadi Party</a> leader Azam Khan lost his Uttar Pradesh Assembly membership in October 2022 after he was convicted in a hate speech case. Defamation does not fall in this list.</p>\n<p>Section 8(2) also lists offences that deal with hoarding or profiteering, adulteration of food or drugs and for conviction and sentence of at least six months for an offence under any provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act.</p>\n<p>Section 8(3) states: “A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release.”</p>\n<h2>How does the disqualification operate?</h2>\n<p>The disqualification can be reversed if a higher court grants a stay on the conviction or decides the appeal in favour of the convicted lawmaker.</p>\n<p>In a 2018 decision in ‘Lok Prahari v Union of India’, the Supreme Court clarified that the disqualification “will not operate from the date of the stay of conviction by the appellate court.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Significantly, the stay cannot merely be a suspension of sentence under Section 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), but a stay of conviction.

Following this, the University Grants Commission (UGC) wrote to all Central Universities on March 16, requesting them to furnish information answering the MP’s question.</p><p>The three-part question by Yadav read, “whether Government has taken cognizance of the fact that a book by Pakistani author is being taught at Aligarh Muslim University, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/jamia-millia-islamia-cuet-admissions-8478487/\"><strong>Jamia Millia Islamia</strong></a> or any other educational institution in the country and the language is derogatory to Indian citizens and also supports terrorism.”</p>\n<p>Pradhan on Thursday replied, “The Central Universities such as Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia are autonomous institutions established by the Acts of Parliament. They are governed by their own set of rules such as Statutes and Ordinances framed under their respective Acts.”</p>\n<p>“The Departments of these Universities/Institutions have Curriculum Development Committee which suggests books for the students to the Board of Studies. In the library of these Universities/ Institutions, the Board of Studies of the Departments recommends list of books to the University Librarian for procurement. The data relating to books recommended by the Board of Studies of Departments of these Universities/ Institutions are not maintained centrally,” the answer further said.</p>\n<h2>Why have scholars objected to Yadav’s question?</h2>\n<p>After the question was asked by Yadav, 252 academics, scholars and teachers raised an objection to it. The scholars, including Romila Thapar, Professor Emerita, JNU; Nandita Narain, Associate Professor, St. Stephen’s College; Satish Deshpande, Professor, University of <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a>; Apoorvanand, Professor, University of Delhi; and Ayesha Kidwai, Professor, JNU, said the language of the question was “deliberately ambiguous”.</p>\n<p>The signatories said that “while it appears that a specific book by a specific author is the subject of the question, neither the author nor the book is named”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“…For leaving the book unnamed allows the question to be read as suggesting that any book by any Pakistani author that might possibly be read as being “derogatory to Indian citizens” and “supporting terrorism” must not be taught in any Indian university; that teaching any such book will result in punitive action and perhaps criminal charges being lodged against teachers,” reads the letter.</p>\n<h2>Why did the Aligarh Muslim University drop two Islamic scholars from the varsity syllabus?</h2>\n<p>In August last year, the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/education/amu-drops-teachings-of-two-islamic-scholars-from-syllabus-8066247/\"><strong>AMU had dropped teachings of two Islamic scholars</strong></a> from their syllabus of the Department of Islamic Studies. Officials at the varsity had said the decision was taken after some complaints were received that the teachings of the authors were “objectionable”. The move to drop the scholars had come after an open letter was written to Prime Minister <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/narendra-modi/\">Narendra Modi</a> by 25 scholars.

Professors at the department had said that “one doesn’t have to agree with every scholar they read and removing scholars from syllabus was against the idea of a free university where debate and discussion can happen”.</p>\n<h2>Who were the two Islamic scholars whose teachings were removed from AMU syllabus?</h2>\n<p>The two scholars whose teachings were removed were Turkish author and Islamic scholar Sayyid Qutb and Pakistan author Abul A’la al-Maududi. The teachings of the two authors were being taught for Masters in the Department of Islamic Studies as optional papers. The optional papers taught about them were titled ‘Maulana Madudi and his thoughts’ and ‘Sayyid Qutb and his thoughts”.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/who-is-zakir-naik-8512397/\">Zakir Naik: What charges does the controversial preacher face in India, where is he now</a></div>\n<p>Sayyid Qutb was a leading member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood – a Sunni Islamist religious, political, and social movement — in the 1950s and 1960s and is considered as “the father of Salafi jihadism”.

On World TB Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/pm-to-address-one-world-tb-summit-in-varanasi-tomorrow-8513499/\">address the One World TB Summit on Friday</a></strong>.

Reporting of TB cases also improved in 2021 – although it didn’t reach the pre-pandemic levels, it bounced back from the lows seen during the first year of the pandemic, according to the Global TB Report 2022.</p><p>The incidence of TB – new cases detected through the year – reduced by 18% in 2021 over the 2015 baseline, dropping to 210 cases per lakh population as compared to 256 cases per lakh population. The incidence of drug-resistant TB also went down by 20% during the period from 1.49 lakh cases in 2015 to 1.19 lakh cases in 2021.</p>\n<p>India accounts for 28% of all TB cases in the world, according to the Global TB Report 2022.</p>\n<p>There were 21.3 lakh cases detected in 2021 as compared to 18.05 lakh cases in 2020. The numbers are still lower than the 24.04 lakh cases reported before the pandemic in 2019, according to data from the government’s Ni-kshay portal that can help in real-time reporting of new TB cases.</p>\n<p>A survey conducted across 20 states pegged the incidence at a higher 312 cases per lakh population.</p>\n<p><strong>What is India’s elimination target?</strong></p>\n<p>Although elimination of Tuberculosis is one of the sustainable development targets to be achieved by 2030 by the world, India has set the target of 2025. The national strategic plan 2017-2025 sets the target of India reporting no more than 44 new TB cases or 65 total cases per lakh population by 2025. The estimated TB incidence for the year 2021 stood at 210 per lakh population.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Achieving this target is a big task as the plan had envisaged an incidence of only 77 cases per lakh population by 2023.</p>\n<p>The programme also aims to reduce the mortality to 3 deaths per lakh population by 2025. The estimated TB mortality for the year 2020 stood at 37 per lakh population.</p>\n<p>The plan also aims to reduce catastrophic costs for the affected family to zero. However, the report states that 7 to 32 per cent of those with drug sensitive TB, and 68 per cent with drug-resistant TB experienced catastrophic costs.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The goals are in line with the World Health Organisation’s End TB strategy that calls for 80% reduction in the number of new cases, 90% reduction in mortality, and zero catastrophic cost by 2030.</p>\n<p><strong>What is being done to try to achieve this target?</strong></p>\n<p>To achieve the TB elimination target of 2025, the government has taken several steps including looking for cases actively among vulnerable and co-morbid populations, screening for it at the health and wellness centres, and calling on the private sector to notify all TB cases.</p>\n<p>An online Ni-kshay portal has been set up to track the notified TB cases.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has led to improved access to the more accurate molecular diagnostic tests like CB-NAAT and TureNat that were also used to test for <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/\">Covid-19</a>. At present, there are 4,760 molecular diagnostic machines available, covering all districts of the country. In addition, 79 line probe assay laboratories and 96 liquid culture testing laboratories have been set up for the diagnosis of multi and extremely drug resistant TB.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The government has also implemented a universal drug susceptibility test, meaning that antibiotic susceptibility of the mycobacterium is determined for all newly diagnosed cases. Earlier, the patients were started on first line treatment and were tested for drug resistance only if the therapy did not work. Conducting a drug susceptibility test at the outset ensures that the patients are given antibiotics that will work for them from the get go.</p>\n<p>Last year, the government also launched the community engagement programme where Ni-kshay mitras can adopt TB patients and provide them monthly nutritional support. So far, 71,460 Ni-kshay Mitras have adopted about 10 lakh TB patients under the programme.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the improvements in treatment protocols?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Newer drugs such as Bedaquiline and Delamanid for the treatment of drug resistant TB have been included in the government’s basket of drugs provided free TB patients. These oral drugs can replace the injectable kanamycin that was associated with serious side effects like kidney problems and deafness.</p>\n<p>These new drugs have also been included in the new National List of Essential Medicines that gives the government power to regulate their market price as well.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Researchers have also been studying shorter three- and four-month courses of anti-tubercular drugs, instead of the existing six-month therapy. Anti-tubercular drugs have to be taken for six months to over two years depending on the susceptibility of the mycobacterium. Long duration of treatment results in people dropping out in between, increasing their likelihood of them developing drug resistant infections later.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there newer vaccines in the pipeline?</strong></p>\n<p>Nearly a 100 years after the existing BCG vaccine was developed, researchers are on the lookout for newer ways of preventing tuberculosis infection. The BCG vaccine uses a weakened form of the TB bacteria to train the immune system. Although it can protect against severe forms of TB like the ones in the brain, the protection is not very good against the most common form of TB in the lungs.</p>\n<p>It offers limited protection to adults, it doesn’t prevent people from getting the infection or re-activation of a latent infection.</p>\n<p>Trials are underway to test the effectiveness of a vaccine called Immuvac, which was initially developed to prevent leprosy, in preventing TB. The vaccine developed using mycobacterium indicus pranii has antigens – the portions of a pathogen against which antibodies are developed – similar to those of leprosy and TB bacteria.</p>\n<p>Researchers are also testing the vaccine candidate called VPM1002, which is a recombinant form of the BCG vaccine modified to express the TB antigens better. This results in better training of the immune system and protection against TB.</p>\n<p>Researchers are also studying whether the existing BCG vaccine booster shot should be given to household contacts of a person with active tuberculosis.</p>\n</div> </div>\n",

While he himself was a strong proponent of Gandhi’s ideas of non-violence, he admired Bhagat Singh’s bravery and understood his revolutionary methods.</p>\n<h2>Why was Bhagat Singh hanged?</h2>\n<p>On March 23, 1931, revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar and S Rajguru were hanged at 7.30 pm in the premises of the Lahore Jail. The trio had been convicted in what came to be known as the ‘Lahore Conspiracy Case’, for the murder of British police officer John Saunders in 1928.</p>\n<p>The trial that convicted Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru was contentious. To speed the process, Viceroy Lord Irwin passed an ordinance to set up a special tribunal comprising three high court judges. This is seen by legal historians as an injustice as it abruptly, and for no legitimate reason, upended the due process of law to swiftly arrive at a judgement. Crucially, the only appeal after the tribunal was to the Privy Council – the highest court in the British Empire – located in England.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/rahul-gandhi-defamation-case-guilty-disqualification-explained-8514133/\">Rahul Gandhi has been convicted, but what happens to his MP status? Here’s what the law says</a></div>\n<p>Despite petitions challenging Irwin’s ordinance as illegal, the trial went on. On October 7, 1930, the tribunal delivered a 300-page judgement and concluded that based on available evidence, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru participated in Saunders’ murder.</p>\n<p>They were sentenced to death by hanging, despite themselves requesting a shooting squad instead. Singh would write in one of his last letters, “I have been arrested while waging a war. For me there can be no gallows. Put me into the mouth of a cannon and blow me off.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What did Nehru say about Bhagat Singh?</h2>\n<p>Jawaharlal Nehru angrily denounced the tribunal’s judgement, British academic Satvinder Singh Juss wrote in his book <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bhagat-singh-death-anniversary-new-book-on-trial-7240751/\"><strong><em>The Trial of Bhagat Singh</em></strong></a>. In a speech in Allahabad on October 12, 1930, he criticised not just the tribunal, but also the Viceroy and the British regime on a whole.</p>\n<p>“If England were invaded by Germany or Russia, would Lord Irwin go about advising the people to refrain from violence against invaders? If he is not prepared to do that, let him not raise the issue. It is for Mahatma Gandhi and others, who believe with him, to do so … But let there be no mistake about it. Whether I agree with him or not, my heart is full of admiration for the courage and self-sacrifice of a man like Bhagat Singh. Courage of the Bhagat Singh type is exceedingly rare. If the Viceroy expects us to refrain from admiring this wonderful courage and high purpose behind it, he is mistaken. Let him ask his own heart what he would have felt if Bhagat Singh had been an Englishman and acted for England,” Jawaharlal Nehru told a large crowd that had gathered to hear him speak.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/protests-macrons-pension-reforms-penchant-to-protest-8512895/\">Agitation against Macron’s pension reforms: Understanding France’s ‘penchant to protest’</a></div>\n<p>In his speech, Nehru did not only justify violence used by the revolutionaries by pretty much using the same arguments they themselves made, he openly stated his disagreement with friend and mentor, Mahatma Gandhi.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Did Nehru have sympathies for revolutionaries?</h2>\n<p>Nehru always sympathised with Indian revolutionaries even though he himself did not believe in or preach violence. His socialist background allowed him to understand the justifications for revolutionary violence and he repeatedly wrote about the courage of the revolutionaries.</p>\n<p>While Gandhi often outrightly condemned revolutionary activities, Nehru saw revolutionaries fighting their own struggle and appreciated them for it. In 1929, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/did-no-congress-leader-meet-bhagat-singh-in-prison-narendra-modi-karnataka-elections-5172021/\"><strong>he even met Bhagat Singh</strong></a> and fellow inmates at the Mianwali Jail, at a time when they were on a hunger strike demanding better treatment as ‘political prisoners’.</p>\n<p>After the meeting, he would say, “I was very much pained to see the distress of the heroes. They have staked their lives in this struggle. They want that political prisoners be treated as political prisoners. I am quite hopeful that their sacrifice would be crowned with success.”</p>\n<p>He would later write about this in his autobiography. “It was very painful for me to meet these extraordinarily brave young men and to see their manifest suffering. I gather from them that they would adhere to their resolve, whatever the consequences to their individual selves might be. Indeed, they didn’t care very much for their own selves,” Nehru wrote in admiration of the suffering.</p>\n<p>After the hanging, in an annual Congress session, Nehru moved an official resolution, which was seconded by Madan Mohan Malviya. Despite Congress’s official position decrying any violence, the resolution condemned the execution. It read, “This Congress is of the opinion that this triple execution is an act of wanton vengeance and is a deliberate flouting of the unanimous demand of the nation for commutation”.</p>\n</div> ",

Edited by: Tamsin Walker)</em></strong></p>\n<p>While around 70% of Earth’s surface is covered with water, less than 1% percent is actually drinkable.</p><p>These finite freshwater resources are very unevenly distributed.</p>\n<p>In hot, dry regions with growing populations and increasing living standards, there is not enough water to go around — a situation exacerbated by climate change.</p>\n<p>As solutions such as cloud seeding or even iceberg harvesting remain unproven at scale, the desalination of our oceans into drinking water has emerged as the ultimate means to drought-proof regions suffering water poverty.</p>\n<p>The centuries-old concept uses thermal distillation or a reverse osmosis membrane to separate salt from the sea.</p>\n<p>The technique is now being utilized globally, with well over 20,000 desalination plants currently operating in over 170 countries — the 10 largest in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Around 47% of the world’s desalinated water is produced in the Middle East and North Africa alone, Manzoor Qadir, deputy director of the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health, told DW.</p>\n<p>These arid regions have few other options since, according to Qadir, they generate less than 500 cubic meters of water per capita through rainfall or river runoff — which is half the upper limit of water scarcity as defined by the UN. The United States, by contrast, produces 1,207 cubic meters of freshwater per person.</p>\n<p>Water poverty is set to worsen as populations increase along with temperatures, with Sub-Saharan Africa predicted to become a “hotspot of water scarcity” by 2050, Qadir noted.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/the-high-seas-treaty-key-provisions-and-the-challenges-it-faces-8513426/\">The High Seas Treaty: Key provisions, and the challenges it faces</a></div>\n<p>“It is a great option in terms of enhancing water resources,” he said of desalination, adding that costs have “decreased tremendously” — from around $5 ($4.69) per cubic meter (1,000 liters) in the 2000s to 50 cents today.</p>\n<p>“It’s a no brainer,” said Frithjof C. Kuepper, chair in marine biodiversity at the University of Aberdeen and an expert on the environmental impacts of desalination in Cyprus. “For countries like Cyrpus, there’s no other option if they want to maintain this living standard.”</p>\n<p>The hottest and driest nation in the EU, Cyprus relies on desalination for 80% of its drinking water, according to Kuepper.</p>\n<p>With variable rainfall necessitating water restrictions in the country as far back as the 1990s, Kuepper explains that Cyprus’ government first tried to make up the shortfall by shipping in water from Greece.</p>\n<p>“But it cost about ten times more than desalinating,” he said, adding that the government started to build desalination plants in the early 2000s to avoid water shortages.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Marine and climate impacts of desalination</h2>\n<p>But both Kuepper and Qadir concede that before becoming a magic bullet for water scarcity, desalination presents some serious environmental trade-offs in its current guise.</p>\n<p>Firstly, separating salt from water is highly energy intensive.</p>\n<p>A 2021 studyon the environmental consequences of removing salt from seawater in Cyprus co-authored by Kuepper showed that the four desalination plants in the country generate around 2% of its total greenhouse gas emissions.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ipcc-synthesis-key-takeaways-8510544/\">IPCC releases its Synthesis Report: What are the key takeaways</a></div>\n<p>The plants also accounted for 5% of the total electricity consumption in Cyprus, representing one of the largest shares by sector of electricity consumption, according to the study.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the report notes that desalinated water produced generated around 103 million cubic meters of toxic, high-salinity brine effluent that impacted the Mediterranean seagrass ecosystem in the region of the discharge pipes.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In a reportco-authored by Manzoor Qadir on the state of desalination and brine production globally, it was shown that increased salinity, combined with climate-driven temperature rise, can cause a decrease in the dissolved oxygen content, resulting in conditions called hypoxia.</p>\n<p>This hypersaline water can sink to the ocean bed and kill marine microorganisms that are vital to the entire food chain. In addition, chemical compounds such as copper and chloride are also observable in the desalination pre-treatment process and can be toxic to organisms in the receiving water, according to the report.</p>\n<h2>Making desalination sustainable</h2>\n<p>The authors of the Cyprus study conclude that the solution to the relatively high CO2 emissions is to deploy renewables to power desalination plants.</p>\n<p>A Berlin-based company, Boreal Light, has developed off-grid solar and wind energy desalination plants that ensure greater energy independence and immunity from price fluctuations.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/water-warning-economic-stability-vanishing-rainfall-8503886/\">Water warning: How ‘vanishing’ rainfall is threatening economic stability</a></div>\n<p>“We’ve got the water for free, we’ve got the electricity from the solar and wind for free, so we can now produce 1,000 liters [of fresh water] for 50 cents,” Ali Al-Hakim, Boreal Light co-founder and general manager, told DW. The price for one cubic meter is as competitive as directly accessing freshwater from rivers or wells, he added — and is equal to today’s cheaper desalination cost as quoted by Manzoor Qadir.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, though brine discharge can be better diffused through outfall pipes that are not in the vicinity of vulnerable marine life, Kuepper said a better solution would be to keep the remnant solids on the land.</p>\n<p>The 2019 study on the state of desalination showed how sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium, bromine, boron, strontium, lithium, rubidium and uranium could be harvested from the filtered material and reused in industry and agriculture. Recovery of these resources remains economically uncompetitive, however, Qadir believes.</p>\n<p>This needs to change as reuse is an important sustainability solution, he added, especially “in countries producing large volumes of brine with relatively low efficiencies, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait and Qatar.”</p>\n<h2>Reusing the brine</h2>\n<p>Scientists at the US research body, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), have suggested ways to repurpose brine by using the salt to produce caustic soda, or sodium hydroxide.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/ocean-un-high-seas-treaty-draft-agreement-explained-8487355/\">Protecting ‘two-thirds of the world’s oceans’: What the UN High Seas Treaty draft agreement says</a></div>\n<p>When used to pre-treat seawater entering the desalination plant, sodium hydroxide helps prevent the fouling of the reverse osmosis membranes used to filter the ocean water. The researchers note that such fouling is a typical source of breakdowns and adds to the energy inefficiency and overall cost.</p>\n<p>Although such brine reuse is still in the early developmental stage, Qadir notes that newer, more modern plants in the US that utilize the latest reverse osmosis technology already produce less brine.</p>\n<p>Around 12% of the world’s desalinated water is created in the US but only 3.9% of its brine, Qadir explains. By contrast, the Middle East and North Africa region generates around 47% of desalinated water but 70% of the total global brine output, he says, due partly to the presence of less efficient plants.</p>\n<p>As the technology continues to improve, climate and environmental impacts will be reduced, says Qadir.</p>\n<p>Kuepper says desalination is the obvious way to go. “Our job is to make sure it is sustainable.”</p>\n</div> ",

After Parliament reassembles, the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) draws up a schedule for discussions on the Demands for Grants. Given the limitation of time, the House cannot take up the expenditure demands of all Ministries; therefore, the BAC identifies some important Ministries for discussions. It usually lists Demands for Grants of the Ministries of Home, Defence, External Affairs, Agriculture, Rural Development and Human Resource Development.

Within that period, Gandhi can file an appeal against the sentence before the High Court.</p>\n<h2>What do IPC sections 499 and 500 say?</h2>\n<p>Defamation is a wrong that deals with damage caused to a person’s reputation.</p>\n<p>In India, defamation can both be a civil wrong and a criminal offence, depending on the objective they seek to achieve. A civil wrong sees a wrong being redressed with monetary compensation, while a criminal law seeks to punish a wrongdoer and send a message to others not to commit such acts, with a jail term. In a criminal case, defamation has to be established beyond reasonable doubt but in a civil defamation suit, damages can be awarded based on probabilities.</p>\n<p>Section 499 of the IPC defines what amounts to criminal defamation and subsequent provisions define its punishment. Section 499 elaborates on how defamation could be through words – spoken or intended to be read, through signs, and also through visible representations. These can either be published or spoken about a person with the intention of damaging reputation of that person, or with the knowledge or reason to believe that the imputation will harm his reputation.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Section 500 stipulates imprisonment of up to two years, with or without a fine, for someone held guilty of criminal defamation.</p>\n<p><strong><em>(With PTI inputs)</em></strong></p>\n</div> ",

In Paris, workers have refused to collect garbage, which has been piling up on the streets for days, along with its sickening stench.</p><div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-garbage-is-piling-up-in-the-streets-of-france-8498519/\">Garbage piling up on Paris streets: What’s happening in France?</a></div>\n<p>“Anger is growing,” a 48-year old striking worker told <em>The Guardian</em>. “This has gone far beyond pensions, it is about our political system. The president has executive powers that need to be rethought. It’s about protecting France’s whole postwar system of social protection. It’s about hanging on to our welfare state, as Macron tries to unpick it – from housing benefits to the unemployment system. French people are well informed and politicised, they won’t let this pass.”</p>\n<p>On Monday, Macron’s government narrowly survived two no-confidence votes. Unions have called for a massive nationwide day of protests on Thursday (March 23), <em>Reuters</em> reported.</p>\n<h2>The French penchant for protesting</h2>\n<p>The French are often perceived to have a penchant for protesting. While this stereotype might be slightly overblown, France boasts of a long history of anti-establishment social movements which have enjoyed a fair degree of success. Charles De Gaulle referred to it as his country’s “perpetual political effervescence”.</p>\n<p>But certain data suggests that this perception might not be very accurate. Compared with other western democracies, especially in Europe, France does not statistically see a much greater number of protests. Neither are French citizens more agreeable to protests than their counterparts. However, while protest “might not be a uniquely French activity”, it remains “an important element of French culture and politics”, wrote political scientist Frank R Baumgartner.</p>\n<p>Notably, Baumgartner adds, “some of its (protests’) forms in France are different than in other countries, and some types of protest appear to be more effective in France than in other countries”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Political scientist Frank L Wilson, in ‘Political Demonstrations in France: Protest Politics Or Politics of Ritual?’, links this very visible image of a “protest society” to the colourful tactics used by demonstrators, their focus on Paris, and a firm anti-establishment position. To understand the unique culture of protest in France, one has to look back at the nation’s history.</p>\n<h2>Charivari and a “culture of retribution”</h2>\n<p>During the Middle Ages, a form of collective action known as ‘charivari’ was popular across many parts of Europe, including France, where both the word and the custom likely originated. The custom involved groups of young men surrounding people accused of having committed moral offences (for instance, having sex out of wedlock). They would then loudly bang pots and pans and shame the alleged offenders. Often, charivari would devolve into brutal retributive violence.</p>\n<p>Over time, charivari started taking distinctly political tones, targeting figures such as corrupt officials or tax collectors. Thus, what used to be customs concerned with social transgression transformed into acts of political mobilisation, carrying with them both the raucousness as well as the violence of the charivari.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Historian William Beik writes that something that struck him while researching French urban history was what he called “a culture of retribution”. “Groups of relatively disenfranchised individuals from the middle to lower ranks of a local community, but lacking any formal institutional identity, would mobilise either spontaneously or after informal meetings and discussions, to attack an abuse of power by those in authority,” he writes.</p>\n<p>The essence of traditions such as the charivari and the ‘culture of retribution’ can be found in today’s protests, often in more symbolic forms. For instance, during the current wave of protests, there have been multiple instances of effigy burnings of political leaders with “We beheaded Louis XVI and we can do it again with President Macron” being a common refrain.</p>\n<h2>The Revolution and the scepticism that followed</h2>\n<p>The French public guillotined Louis XVI on January 21, 1793 at the Place de la Concorde in Paris. This was a momentous occasion as the ‘public’ took power in its own hands, to remove a ruler seen as apathetic as well as to address systemic socio-economic problems. Crucially, the Revolution created French national consciousness as we know it, around the romantic ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity.</p>\n<p>These ideals continue to be a central feature in France’s culture of protest with every protest eventually boiling down to citizens talking of upholding these ideals. At the same time, every perceived authoritarian figure also draws comparisons to Louis XVI.</p>\n<p>Moreover, not only did the Revolution permanently cement the French public’s ‘anti-establishment’ credentials, what followed the Revolution also imbibed the populace with deep lying cynicism that can be seen in France’s various intellectual traditions, all the way till de Beauvoir, Sartre and Foucault.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Unlike the idyllic utopia that the Revolution promised to bring, it brought instead the Jacobin Reign of Terror, Napoleon, and eventually, the strengthening of French capitalism and the modern nation state. All this while the masses of France saw paltry improvements in their own lives. According to sociologist Charles Tilly, the gradual transformation of folk traditions such as the charivari to a cultural political protest has to be seen in this context. These traditions were kept alive in language that borrowed deeply from the intellectual currents surrounding the Revolution to respond to grievances that never quite went away.</p>\n<h2>France’s strong-weak unions</h2>\n<p>Today, the unique position of France’s extremely active unions explains the persistence of the nation’s protest culture, a <em>Vox </em> report suggests. Labour historian Stephan Sirot notes the paradoxical position of French unions. On one hand, France has the highest number of trade unions but on the other, it boasts among the lowest percentage of workers who are a part of the union, with the average number standing around 8 per cent of all workers (compared to 25 per cent in Europe).</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“The political influence of French unions is abnormal,” Radu Vranceanu, research director at the Grande Ecole de Commerce in Paris, told <em>Reuters</em>. “It’s not at all in line with their capacity to mobilise people.”</p>\n<p>These unions gain a lot of power not from their membership but conditions (in the form of laws and rules) which are favourable to them. This makes them take extreme positions on anything they might have a disagreement with – they protest constantly lest their position be changed via executive fiat. On the part of the capitalist “management”, they too often begin negotiations in bad faith, starting off with an extreme, often untenable proposal before watering it down post the inevitable union protests.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“French unions must often stage radical action as a prerequisite for obtaining good faith negotiations that big unions in the UK and Germany are granted out of hand, out of management’s respect of their power,” political scientist Guy Groux told <em>Time</em> magazine.</p>\n<h2>The ritual of protest and the politics of ritual</h2>\n<p>Over time, protests have become an intrinsic part of France’s politics not as a way to shake the system but as a ritualised performance within it. “In France, contemporary political protests flow out of a rich history of contention that is full of drama and passion. Protest has become an important popular art in France,” Wilson wrote.</p>\n<p>Major protests are near festive events with protesters often engaging in street dances and small gatherings in bars before and after the march. Yet the drama of France’s ritualised protests does not diminish their political value. Indeed much of the value, including strongly held stereotypes regarding protesting French persons, comes from the ritual of protest itself.</p>\n<p>Wilson suggests that policymaking in response to protest events should not be the only measure of a protests’ efficacy. In fact, in France, protests usually crystallise over vetoing existing policies rather than proposing new ones (like we see currently with Macron’s Bill). Rather, the success of protests also lies in their ability to foster political consciousness, remind people of their power, and keep politicians inconvenienced and on their toes. In this, the ritualised theatrics of France’s protests play an all-important role.</p>\n</div> ",

In addition to same-sex intercourse, the law bans “promoting and abetting” homosexuality as well as “conspiracy to engage in homosexuality”.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/which-countries-in-the-world-allow-same-sex-marriage-8494555/\">Which countries in the world allow same-sex marriage &amp; through what routes?</a></div>\n<p>Supporters of the new law say it is needed to punish a broader array of LGBTQ activities, which they say threaten traditional values in the conservative and religious East African nation.</p>\n<p>Violations under the law draw severe penalties, including death for so-called aggravated homosexuality and life in prison for gay sex. Aggravated homosexuality involves gay sex with people under the age of 18 or when the perpetrator is HIV positive, among other categories, according to the law.</p>\n<p><strong>Support and Opposition to the law</strong></p>\n<p>The legislation was supported by nearly all of the 389 members of parliament. Lawmaker David Bahati said during debate on the bill, “Our creator God is happy (about) what is happening … I support the bill to protect the future of our children.”</p>\n<p>Frank Mugisha, a prominent Ugandan LGBTQ activist, denounced the legislation as draconian. “This law is very extreme and draconian … it criminalises being an LGBTQ person, but also they are trying to erase the entire existence of any LGBTQ Ugandan,” he said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>A rights activist told the <em>BBC</em> that a fear of more attacks on gay people has arisen. “There is a lot of blackmail. People are receiving calls that ‘if you don’t give me money, I will report that you are gay,'” the activist said.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Amnesty International called the Bill “appalling”, “ambiguous” and “vaguely worded”. “This deeply repressive legislation will institutionalise discrimination, hatred, and prejudice against LGBTI people — including those who are perceived to be LGBTI — and block the legitimate work of civil society, public health professionals, and community leaders,” said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s director for East and Southern Africa.</p>\n<p><strong>Status of the LGBTQ community in Uganda</strong></p>\n<p>Gay Ugandans already face legal discrimination and mob violence. In recent weeks, Uganda authorities have cracked down on LGBTQ people after religious leaders and politicians alleged students were being recruited into homosexuality in schools.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>This month, authorities arrested a secondary school teacher in the eastern district of Jinja over accusations of “grooming of young girls into unnatural sex practices”. She was subsequently charged with gross indecency and is in prison awaiting trial. The police this week also arrested six people accused of running a network that was “actively involved in the grooming of young boys into acts of sodomy”.</p>\n<p>The Ugandan agency overseeing the work of NGOs last year stopped the operations of <strong><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/03/06/ugandas-parliament-threatens-criminalize-homosexuality\">Sexual Minorities Uganda</a></strong>, the most prominent LGBTQ organisation in the country, accusing it of failing to register legally. But the group’s leader stated that his organisation had been rejected by the registrar of companies as undesirable.</p>\n<p><strong>Status of LGBTQ rights in Africa</strong></p>\n<p>More than 30 of Africa’s 54 countries, including Uganda, already ban homosexuality. Additionally, of the 69 countries that have laws criminalising homosexuality, nearly half are in Africa.</p>\n<p>However, efforts are on in the direction of decriminalisation of homosexuality too. Angola’s President Joao Lourenco in February brought into effect revised penal code to allow same-sex relationships and banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Gabon reversed a law that had criminalised homosexuality and made gay sex punishable with six months of imprisonment. Meanwhile, Botswana’s High Court ruled in favour of decriminalising homosexuality in 2019 and Mozambique and the Seychelles scrapped anti-homosexuality laws. A Trinidad and Tobago court ruled that laws banning gay sex were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p><strong>Status of LGBTQ rights in India</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The Supreme Court recently referred to a five-judge Constitution Bench the petitions seeking legal recognition to <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/supreme-court-same-sex-marriages-five-judge-constitution-bench-8494400/\">same-sex marriages</a></strong>, saying the matter raises questions of “seminal importance”.</p>\n<p>In its order, a three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, said the submissions on the issue involve the interplay between constitutional rights and specific legislative enactments, including the Special Marriage Act, besides the rights of transgender couples.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/trans-gays-female-sex-workers-blood-donation-8494145/\">Trans and gay people, women sex workers can’t donate blood: What the Centre said in SC</a></div>\n<p>In 2018, the Supreme Court had repealed Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which criminalises homosexuality. However, there is no legal approval for adoption of children by same-sex couples and blood donation by LGBTQ people is banned.</p>\n<p><strong>Status of LGBTQ rights in rest of the world</strong></p>\n<p>According to Pew Research Center, 62 countries criminalise consensual same-sex acts by law, while 129 countries don’t criminalise them. Only 28 countries in the world recognise same-sex marriages, and 34 others provide for some partnership recognition for same-sex couples, according to International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA). Death penalty is the legally prescribed punishment for homosexual acts in Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In the US, more than 450 anti-LGBTQ Bills have been introduced in various states, said White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, who pointed to a proposed Florida Bill that would give the state the right to separate transgender children from their parents.</p>\n<p>Human Rights Watch said Tennessee, Texas, and Arizona are tabling laws to ban drag performances when children are present. As many as 150 of those would specifically restrict the rights of transgender people, the highest number of Bills targeting transgender people in a single year to date.</p>\n<p>Homosexual activity is legal in all 27 member states of the European Union, and in Central America. All but five nations in the Caribbean and Guyana in South America also legally allow same-sex consensual activity.</p>\n<p>Iraq is one of three Arab-majority countries in the Middle East that doesn’t explicitly criminalize same-sex relationships. The others are Jordan and Bahrain. However, the region largely remains opposed to the idea of homosexuality, which is evident in instances like Saudi government’s campaign to remove rainbow-colored toys from shelves, a state clampdown and threats from a militant Christian group directed at LGBTQ communities in Lebanon, and a hashtag campaign that originated in Egypt recently that uses “fetrah,” the Arabic word for “instinct,” to insist that there can only be two genders, according to <em>DW</em>.</p>\n<p>In the Asian subcontinent, Afghanistan is the only country that has a death penalty in force for homosexuality, but strict punishments are awarded in Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Malaysia and Brunei. On the brighter side, Singapore repealed a law that criminalised sex between men, while Vietnam declared that conversion therapy would be banned.</p>\n<p><em>With inputs from agencies</em></p>\n</div> ",

However, even if it is assumed that some dowry was provided to the daughters, that does not mean that the daughters cease to have any right in the family property,” the court said.</p><h2>What was the case about?</h2>\n<p>The case revolved around a petition filed by the eldest daughter in a family of 10 people, including four sisters and four brothers. In her plea, the petitioner drew attention to a deed of succession executed in her favour by her late father, Antonio Martins, declaring her as the property heir.</p>\n<p>The plea also contested the transfer deed dated September 8, 1990, by way of which her brothers and mother had transferred the petitioner’s family shop to their two other brothers, seeking to declare the same as “null and void.” The daughter also prayed for a permanent injunction restraining her brothers from transferring her property without her written consent.</p>\n<h2>What did the brothers argue?</h2>\n<p>The petitioner’s brothers argued that “sufficient dowry” was provided to all four sisters at the time of their marriage, following which three of them founded the partnership. The suit shop and the property beneath it were brought into the partnership and was an asset of the firm, they contended. Based on this, they argued that neither the petitioner nor her three sisters had any right, title, or interest in the suit shop.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/muslim-couple-remarrying-special-marriage-act-8485423/\">Why a Muslim couple in Kerala is remarrying under the Special Marriage Act</a></div>\n<p>In their counterclaim, the brother also argued that the petitioner’s claim will be barred by the statute of limitations as more than the stipulated three years had passed since the transfer deed was instituted and that the petitioner filed her suit after four years.</p>\n<h2>What did the Trial and Appellate Court hold?</h2>\n<p>The trial court, by a judgment and decree dated May 31, 2003, dismissed the daughter’s suit and partly decreed the counterclaim by canceling her deed of succession. However, the first appellate court upheld the dismissal of the daughter’s suit, set aside the decree in the counterclaim, and upheld the succession deed showing her as one of the successors of the late Antonio Martins.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Following this, the daughter instituted a second appeal before the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/goa/\">Goa</a> Bench of the Bombay High Court questioning the dismissal of her suit. Meanwhile, her brothers did not question the rejection of their counterclaim or the previous declaration of her succession deed as valid.</p>\n<h2>What did the HC court decide?</h2>\n<p>The court observed that although the present suit was filed by the petitioner after four years of instituting the transfer deed, the daughter came to know about it only six weeks prior to the institution of the suit.</p>\n<p>“The limitation period, in this case, was governed by the provisions of Article 59 of the Schedule to The Limitation Act 1963. For a suit to cancel or set aside an instrument or a decree or for the rescission of a contract, the period of limitation prescribed is three years. The time for which this period begins to run is when the facts entitling Plaintiff to have the instrument or Decree canceled or set aside or the contract rescinded first become known to him,” the court noted while observing that the institution of the transfer deed became known to the eldest daughter much after it came into being.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n\n<div>Best of Explained</div><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/express-explained/\"><span>Click here for more</span></a> \n<p>The court also drew attention to the lack of evidence presented by the brothers to prove that their sister possessed knowledge of the transfer deed much before, deeming that this was an essential requirement as per the law laid down in SC’s 1961 ruling in “KS Nanji and Company vs Jatashankar Dossa and others”.</p>\n<p>“Where a person has a right to sue within three years from the date of his coming to know of a certain fact, it is for him to prove that he had the knowledge of the said fact on a particular date, for the said fact would be within his peculiar knowledge. Once sufficient evidence is adduced on this aspect, the onus would shift on the defendants,” the Apex Court had held in the 1961 ruling.</p>\n<p>The Goa Bench of the Bombay High Court also looked at various provisions of the Portuguese Civil Code, 1867, such as Articles 2184, 1565, 2177, and 2016.</p>\n<h2>What provisions of the Code come into the picture?</h2>\n<p>Article 1565 of the Code provides that the parents or grandparents shall not be entitled to sell or mortgage to children or grandchildren if the other children or grandchildren do not consent to the sale or mortgage.</p>\n<p>Denying the defendant’s contention that Article 1565 of the Portuguese Civil Code was repealed by extension of the Transfer of Property Act, 1881 to Goa, the Court reiterated its 2011 decision in “Norberto Paulo Sebastiao Fernandes &amp; ors. vs. Gabriel Sebastiao Idalino Fernandes..” to say that it is clear that the provisions of Article 1565 of the Code are still in force. Therefore, Matilda, the mother, was not entitled to transfer her share in the suit shop to her two sons without the consent of the other sons and daughters, the court said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Moreover, in its 2012 ruling in “Pemavati Basu Naik and ors. vs. Suresh Basu Naikand anr”, the Bombay High Court held that there is an express bar under which the parents cannot sell immovable property to the children without the consent of all the children.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Article 2177 of the Code provides that a co-owner may not, however, dispose of any specific part of the common property unless the same is allotted to him in partition; and the transfer of the right which he has to the share which belongs to him may be restricted in terms of the law. The Court referred to its 1999 ruling in “Jose Antonio Philip Pascoal da Piedade Carlos dos Milagres Miranda vs. Joao Luis Laurente dos Milagres Miranda” to reiterate this. Thus, the court also rejected the defendant’s contention about the repeal of Article 2177 by provisions of Section 44 of the Transfer of Property Act.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“In Joana Errie vs. Albano Vaz and ors., this Court has held that transfer by one co-owner without consent of others is prohibited under Article 2177 of the Code, which continues to be in force in the State of Goa,” the Court added.</p>\n<p>Dismissing the argument of the defendants that an oral partition had taken place, the court highlighted that an “oral partition” was not even contemplated under the provisions of the Code. In this regard, the court drew attention to Article 2184 of the Code, which provides that the partition of immobile assets is null if not carried out in a public deed or public proceedings.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Finally, the court concluded that in this case, it was evident that the ‘plea of partnership property was a weak and misconceived attempt to ward off the legal effects of Articles 1565 and 2177 of the Code” and allowed the appeal in favour of the eldest daughter.</p>\n</div> ",

These areas are home to about 2.2 million marine species and up to a trillion different kinds of microorganisms, according to the Deep Ocean Stewardship Initiative (DOSI), a network of global experts on oceans.</p>\n<p>A number of regional, multilateral and global legal frameworks exist to govern the activities in the oceans, the most important of which is the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS), a 1982 agreement that has near-universal acceptance.</p>\n<p>Among other things, UNCLOS defined the rights and duties of countries in the oceans, the extent of ocean areas over which countries could claim sovereignty, and the legal status of marine resources. It also specified a set of general rules for a range of activities in the oceans including navigation, scientific research, and deep-sea mining.</p>\n<p>The treaty established exclusive economic zones (EEZ), ocean areas up to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the coastline, where a country would have exclusive rights over all economic resources such as fish, oil, minerals, and gas. The high seas are the areas beyond the EEZ of any country.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The UNCLOS came into being much before climate change and biodiversity became major global concerns. Though it asks countries to protect the ocean ecology and conserve its resources, it does not provide the specific mechanisms or processes to do so. Climate change is already influencing, and is being influenced by, ocean systems, and is exacerbating the pressures on marine biodiversity from unregulated human activities. It is these specific challenges — a combination of climate change, biodiversity, and pollution — that the High Seas Treaty seeks to address.</p>\n<p>The High Seas Treaty will work as an implementation agreement under the UNCLOS, much like the Paris Agreement works under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>\n<p><strong>Key provisions of Treaty</strong></p>\n<p>The High Seas Treaty has four main objectives:</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Demarcation of marine protected areas (MPAs), rather like there are protected forests or wildlife areas;</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Sustainable use of marine genetic resources and equitable sharing of benefits arising from them;</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Initiation of the practice of environmental impact assessments for all major activities in the oceans; and</p>\n<p><strong>*</strong> Capacity building and technology transfer.</p>\n<p><strong>MARINE-PROTECTED AREAS:</strong> MPAs are where ocean systems, including biodiversity, are under stress, either due to human activities or climate change. These can be called the national parks or wildlife reserves of the oceans. Activities in these areas will be highly regulated, and conservation efforts similar to what happens in forest or wildlife zones, will be undertaken. Only about 1.44 per cent of high seas are currently protected, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-climate/meeting-indias-carbon-sink-target-co2-emission-paris-climate-conference-8484854/\">Meeting India’s ‘carbon sink’ target</a></div>\n<p>In December last year, at the meeting of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) in Montreal, Canada, countries had agreed to put at least 30 per cent of degraded coastal and marine ecosystems under effective restoration by 2030. MPAs can become an important vehicle to achieve that goal.</p>\n<p><strong>MARINE GENETIC RESOURCES:</strong> Oceans host very diverse life forms, many of which can be useful for human beings in areas like drug development. Genetic information from these organisms is already being extracted, and their benefits are being investigated. The treaty seeks to ensure that any benefits arising out of such efforts, including monetary gains, are free from strong intellectual property rights controls, and are equitably shared amongst all. The knowledge generated from such expeditions are also supposed to remain openly accessible to all.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p><strong>ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENTS:</strong> The high seas are international waters that are open for use by all countries. Under the provisions of the new treaty, commercial or other activities that can have significant impact on the marine ecosystem, or can cause large-scale pollution in the oceans, would require an environmental impact assessment to be done, and the results of this exercise have to be shared with the international community.</p>\n<p><strong>CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER:</strong> The treaty lays a lot of emphasis on this, mainly because a large number of countries, especially small island states and landlocked nations, do not have the resources or the expertise to meaningfully participate in the conservation efforts, or to take benefits from the useful exploitation of marine resources. At the same time, the obligations put on them by the Treaty, to carry out environmental impact assessments for example, can be an additional burden.</p>\n<p><strong>Difficult road ahead</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The treaty is the result of more than 20 years of protracted negotiations. The details of all the major contentious provisions, including environmental impact assessments, sharing of benefits from genetic resources, and mobilisation of funds for conservation activities, are still to be worked out. Many issues remain unaddressed, including the mechanisms for policing the protected areas, the fate of the projects that are assessed to be heavily polluting, and the resolution of disputes.</p>\n<p>The process of ratification is not expected to be easy. It took UNCLOS 12 years to become international law because the necessary number of ratifications was not reached. The Kyoto Protocol, the precursor to the Paris Agreement, also took eight years to come into effect.</p>\n</div> ",

          "title": "An Expert Explains: In IBC discussion paper, question of distribution of proceeds among creditors",
          "description": "",
          "content": "<div id=\"pcl-full-content\" morss_own_score=\"5.769230769230769\" morss_score=\"12.141571194762685\"><p>The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has released a discussion paper that proposes several changes to the Insolvency &amp; Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. One of the proposals is about the distribution of proceeds to different classes of creditors (Paragraph 9.6 of the discussion paper). Under the IBC, a resolution applicant submits a plan to deal with the outstanding debts of a company by bringing proceeds under the plan. A committee of financial creditors votes on the financial viability &amp; feasibility of the resolution plan. The quantum &amp; manner of distribution under the Code has long been an issue of discontent for unsecured &amp; junior creditors.</p><div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"5.74468085106383\" morss_score=\"70.24468085106383\">\n<p><strong>How are proceeds distributed among creditors under the IBC?</strong></p>\n<p>A company may have various creditors — public sector banks, private lenders, non-banking financial companies, trade creditors, vendors, workmen, employees, governments, etc. The Code puts these creditors into different categories based on the nature of debt. Banks, bond issuers, and lenders are classified as financial creditors. Trade creditors &amp; vendors are classified as operational creditors. Financial creditors are further categorised as secured and unsecured creditors, based on the security furnished by the borrower company.</p><p>Section 53 of the Code prescribes an order of priority in which proceeds will be distributed to the creditors based on the liquidation value. As per this waterfall mechanism, secured financial creditors rank the highest in the order of priority. They are followed by unsecured financial creditors, government dues and, finally, operational creditors.</p>\n<p>The creditors receive proceeds (even if in surplus over the liquidation value) under the resolution plan in order of the above mentioned priority. Hence, financial creditors like banks have the first claim until exhaustion. Proceeds may be extinguished at the level of financial creditors itself, leaving almost nothing for other creditors in the waterfall mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the discussion paper propose?</strong></p>\n<p>The discussion paper acknowledges concerns among creditors regarding inequitable distribution. It says there is a need to devise an objective formula so that the distribution is fair and equitable for all creditors. Therefore, it proposes a statutory scheme wherein the liquidation value will be distributed in accordance with the waterfall mechanism under Section 53. However, any surplus over such liquidation value shall be pro-rated amongst all the creditors in ratio of their unsatisfied claims.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the impact of this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>First, it impacts the inter-creditor distribution in an attempt to bring fairness and equity. As of now, a secured financial creditor is statutorily entitled to have his claim satisfied in priority to an unsecured financial creditor. The proposal seeks to dilute that statutory entitlement.</p>\n<p>Say, the liquidation value is Rs 100 and the proceeds under the resolution plan are Rs 150. The claim of secured creditors is Rs 120 and that of other creditors is Rs 200. Under the present regime, secured creditors will receive their claim in full, i.e., Rs 120, and the balance proceeds of Rs 30 out of the resolution plan shall be distributed to other creditors pro-rata.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>As per the proposal, secured creditors will only receive Rs 100, and the balance Rs 50 out of the resolution plan shall be distributed proportionately amongst all creditors. Hence, there is a dilution to the extent of unsatisfied claims of Rs 20 for the secured creditors.</p>\n<p>Secondly, even inter se the same class of creditors, the proposal is bound to change the quantum of distribution. For example, it may be agreed by the committee of creditors that fully secured financial creditors will receive a higher quantum of proceeds than partially secured financial creditors. If the proposal is enacted into law, this distinction of distribution based on coverage and quality of underlying security is also diluted.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the jurisprudence on the subject?</strong></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court in the case of CoC, Essar Steel India Limited versus Satish Kumar Gupta (CA No. 8766-67 of 2019) was faced with a challenge to a ruling by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) holding that securities and security interest are irrelevant, and that financial creditors must be equitably paid irrespective of the security interest.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The Supreme Court reversed the NCLAT finding and emphasised on the importance of valuing security interests separately from unsecured creditors. It held that the security interest of the financial creditors ought to be protected. The Supreme Court upheld the actions of the Committee of Creditors in paying secured creditors amounts based on their value of the security in preference to other creditors.</p>\n<p>Further, Section 30(4) of the Code provides that the CoC while approving a resolution plan can take into account the value of security interest of a secured creditor. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law states that secured creditors may receive payment in value of their security interest while other unsecured &amp; junior creditors may receive nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>How will the proposal impact the insolvency regime and credit markets in India?</strong></p>\n<p>The proposal seeks to partially undo what the Supreme Court held in the Essar Steel case. It is interesting to note that the report of the Banking Law Reforms Committee in 2015 (which served as a precursor to the IBC) saw the Code as a tool to strengthen the bond market and credit environment. However, the proposal may have a detrimental effect on both.</p>\n<p>With the value and quality of security interest being no longer the only determining factor for distribution of proceeds, lenders may want to lend on financially tighter terms, or may demand higher and better security cover so as to cover larger liquidation values.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The Code was also seen as promoting resolution over liquidation. However, in the proposed scenario, it will be more beneficial for the secured creditors to push the company towards liquidation so that they can realise the full value of their security rather than sharing it with other junior creditors or creditors having inferior security interests under a resolution process. The Supreme Court has observed how ignorance of security interest could result in a stymying of the resolution process itself.</p>\n<p>Whether the proposal makes the distribution process fairer and more equitable will depend on which class of creditor one belongs to.</p>\n<p><em><strong>(The author is an advocate based in New <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a>.)</strong></em></p>\n</div> </div>\n",

This has been increased to Rs 25 lakh in the latest budget, which will be implemented from the next financial year. Under this scheme, the government paid as many as 34.77 lakh claims worth Rs 1,940 crore between April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/rajasthan-advocates-protection-bill-explained-8504397/\">Rajasthan govt tables Bill to protect advocates: Why it was introduced, what it says</a></div>\n<p>Secondly, there is the Rajasthan Government Health Scheme for government employees, which includes ministers, current and former MLAs, etc.</p>\n<p>Third is the Nishulk Nirogi Rajasthan, which also includes the Free Medicine scheme. Under this, all OPD and IPD services in government hospitals, including the registration fee, are provided for free. It covers about 1,600 medicines, 928 surgicals and 185 sutures. As of December end, it had benefitted 8.6 crore patients at a cost of Rs 1,072 crore between March-December 2022.</p>\n<p>Four, there is the Free Test scheme which provides for up to 90 free tests in government hospitals attached with medical colleges, 56 tests in district, sub-district hospitals, and so on. Between March-December 2022, 2.93 crore persons had benefited from it.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2><strong>So what was the need for the RTH?</strong></h2>\n<p>Healthcare is close to the heart of Chief Minister Gehlot, who had come up with the Chiranjeevi scheme, and is pushing to develop Rajasthan as a model state when it comes to health. However, his government has often been panned over the implementation of the Chiranjeevi scheme, especially at the end of private hospitals.</p>\n<p>During the debate on the Bill in the Assembly, Health minister Parsadi Lal said, “It is true that despite having a Chiranjeevi card, hospitals sometimes ask a patient for money, to deposit an advance. I get a lot of complaints, and we have even made hospitals return such money…hence we are bringing this Bill.”</p>\n<p>As per the Bill, anyone found in contravention of the Act will be punishable with a fine of up to Rs 10,000 for the first contravention, and up to Rs 25,000 for the subsequent contraventions. However, many have pointed out that the penalty may be too low for hospitals.</p>\n<p>Second, with Congress and <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/\">BJP</a> taking turns to rule Rajasthan and both accusing each other of renaming and altering schemes, bringing an Act would ensure that subsequent governments abide by its provisions and extend free healthcare mandatorily.</p>\n<p>Third, CM Gehlot would hope to be remembered for his welfare schemes, with his legacy of numerous healthcare schemes at the top. The present Bill is a step in that direction.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2><strong>What is the clause about emergency in the RTH?</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the most contentious issues of the RTH was emergency care, leading to protests by doctors.</p>\n<p>After being changed by the Select Committee, the clause that was eventually passed Tuesday states that people will have the right to emergency treatment and care for accidental emergency, emergency due to snake bite/animal bite and any other emergency decided by the State Health Authority under prescribed emergency circumstances.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/rarule-357-of-the-rules-and-procedure-and-conduct-of-business-in-lok-sabha-8510761/\">Rahul Gandhi controversy: What is rule 357 of the Rules and Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha</a></div>\n<p>Importantly, this can be availed without prepayment of requisite fee or charges for prompt and necessary emergency medical treatment and critical care, emergency obstetric treatment and care, by any public or private health institution qualified to provide such care or treatment according to their level of health care.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is the Opposition’s objection to the Bill?</strong></h2>\n<p>During the debate on the Bill Tuesday, the BJP’s opposition primarily centred on two points. It demanded that in case of private facilities, only multispecialty hospitals with 50 beds be included and that there should be a single forum for complaints.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf said, “If a cardiac patient reaches an eye hospital, how will he get treatment? Hence we demand that only multispecialty hospitals with 50 beds be included under the law.” The Health Minister said that this specification for private hospitals will be included in the Rules made as part of the Act.</p>\n<p>Saraf and Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore, both of whom held the health portfolio in the previous government and were part of the Select Committee for the Bill, demanded that the government incorporate these two points in the Bill itself.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/an-expert-explains-in-ibc-discussion-paper-question-of-distribution-of-proceeds-among-creditors-8513416/\">An Expert Explains: In IBC discussion paper, question of distribution of proceeds among creditors</a></div>\n<p>On the demand for a single window system for redressal, Rathore said: “Right now, you can complain against the doctors with the Medical Council, Consumer Court, under the Medical Protection Act, with the Human Rights Commission … there are 50 places where you can complain against a doctor.” Saraf said, “Now you are adding one more forum for complaints. Will the doctor practice or only occupy himself with redressal of complaints?”</p>\n<h2><strong>Why are doctors protesting?</strong></h2>\n<p>Dr Neeraj Damor, president, Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors (JARD), questioned the need for the RTH. “When you already have schemes such as Chiranjeevi which cover the majority of the population under existing rules, why bring RTH and impose it on doctors?” He said that there are several clauses doctors are still objecting to, including defining ‘emergency’, and “compelling doctors of one speciality to treat patients outside their speciality as part of emergency.”</p>\n<p>However, the government has repeatedly said that the definition of “emergency” was reworked only after consultations with doctor associations, while the second part will be addressed in the Rules which will be made subsequently, and hence there is no question of compelling doctors to treat outside their speciality.</p>\n<p>Sunil Chugh, president of IMA Rajasthan, said that the IMA has demanded inclusion of several clauses in the Bill. One of them lists nine “responsibilities and duties” that the patients and caretakers should have towards the healthcare facilities: be respectful to providers; avoid crowding with a patient; not to be abusive or with violent behaviour; timely meet financial responsibilities,” etc.</p>\n<p>Another clause lists as many as 17 “Rights of Health Care Providers,” such as “to be treated with respect by patients and the person attending the patient; to be duly informed when patients are seeking a second opinion; to get the tests done in-house or the nearest lab in case of an emergency to prevent delay in patient care; cost of treatment reimbursement must be within 15 days through a separate portal other than government health insurance schemes,” etc. Chugh says that the suggestions were received after a meeting with office bearers from across the state, and as these demands were not included, the Bill should have been dropped.</p>\n<p>However, government sources said the latest demands are an “addendum” to the doctors’ earlier demands, almost all of which have already been met, and accused the protesting doctors of constantly shifting goalposts so that the Bill is not passed in any form.</p>\n<p>“Earlier, the doctors’ objection was that they were not consulted before the formulation of the Bill. So we sat down with all the associations. They had two major objections: that emergency be defined properly, and that their representatives be included in the state and district health authorities which, they claimed, were dominated by bureaucrats and politicians,” an official said.</p>\n<p>“So we defined the term emergency as per their demand, and even removed the provision for the government nominating two members to state and district authorities in the Bill, and went as far as replacing it with a provision for IMA itself to nominate two representatives to district and state authorities. In the district committee, we also removed Zila Pramukh and three Pradhans of Panchayat Samiti. So we have in fact gone a step further than what they asked,” the official said.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, right now, the private hospitals act on their whims, like insisting on in-house investigation reports, declining to hand over files. The system lacks transparency and they often over-charge for various services. Once the citizens are made aware of their rights through the Act and the system becomes more transparent with the involvement of the government, then perhaps the hospitals won’t be able to mint as much money by charging deceptively. That’s the real reason behind the doctors’ protest,” the official alleged.</p>\n<p>The Bill empowers patients “to choose source of obtaining medicines or tests at all health care establishments”, which means that hospitals cannot insist on in-house medicines or tests.</p>\n<p>If a patient wishes to leave, they will have to be given “treatment summary in case of a patient leaving health care establishment against the medical advice,” or “to obtain treatment records and information from the treating health care establishments to seek second opinion from another health care professional or health care establishment.”</p>\n</div> ",

          "description": "",
          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"4.848000000000001\" morss_score=\"48.50624915824916\">\n<p><strong>So, what led to the separation of Bihar from Bengal?</strong></p><p>In his thesis, ‘Provincial Pasts and National Histories: Territorial Self-Fashioning in Twentieth Century Bihar’, Aryendra Chakravartty of Stephen F. Austin State University (USA) writes that the demand for separating Bihar from Bengal started in the late 19th century, partly for two reasons.</p>\n<p>One, the residents began feeling that the region was “becoming a backwater and a place of little significance for the new rulers of India”. The other was the discovery of the ancient Mauryan capital of <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/elections/pataliputra-lok-sabha-election-results/\">Pataliputra</a> near the modern-day Patna city in 1895, which “not only brought back visions of a glorious past, but also served as a “ghostly reminder of an almost irrecoverable past,” Chakravartty writes.</p>\n<p>Before the British East India Company took over Bihar, Orissa and Bengal, the region, particularly Patna, was synonymous with prosperity and prominence. However, soon after the English came to power, the region’s fortunes fell. Moreover, as Bihar, Orissa and Bengal were all part of the Bengal Presidency and placed under one administrative structure, many believed that the British paid attention only to Calcutta, British India’s capital, and ignored the rest of the region.</p>\n<p>For instance, the introduction and influence of English language in the Bengal Presidency were mostly limited to the British administrative centres of Calcutta. This led to the rise of a Bengali middle class as they dominated not only the administrative jobs but also other modern-day professions in hospitals, courts and schools. Meanwhile, Biharis, “who once monopolized white-collar jobs in the government until 1835”, struggled to gain employment as they didn’t get an opportunity to learn the new language, Chakravartty mentions in his thesis.</p>\n<p>He further says, “In addition, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the Bengalis developed a sense of cultural superiority that was not only predicated on their early access to English education, but was equally derived from their attachment to Bengali language and literature, which served as hallmarks of Bengali culture.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“Often such an outlook meant that Bengalis, as they moved into parts of northern India, maintained a distance from the local society where such behaviour was usually perceived as an exhibition of professional and cultural superiority.”</p>\n<p>This situation didn’t sit well among the modern-day English-spoken Biharis such as Sachchidananda Sinha and Mahesh Narayan, who played a crucial role in elevating the demand for a separate state of Bihar. Together they founded a newspaper, <em>The Behar Times</em>, in 1894 and began writing editorials and columns, promoting the idea of a separate Bihar.</p>\n<p>The demand became much more vocal prior to the 1905 Bengal partition, when Sinha, Narayan and other Biharis “emphasized that the separation of Bihar from Bengal would serve as “the only way in which the different races in the country can be politically unified.”” However, their hopes were dashed as the Britishers broke up Bengal along communal lines rather than from the administrative point of view.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>But the cause for carving out Bihar from Bengal didn’t die down. In fact, as Chakravartty points out, “following 1905, a majority of Bengalis began to look upon the possibility of a separate Bihar more favorably.” New leaders such as Ali Imam, Hassan Iman, Muhammad Fakhruddin and Mazharul Haque also joined the movement. Meanwhile, much like Bihar, the Orissa region of Bengal also started to witness the rise in demand for a separate state.</p>\n<p>In 1908, the first session of the Bihar Provincial Conference was held, where Muhammad Fakhruddin moved a resolution demanding Bihar’s separation from Bengal. Then, in August 1908, the Bihar Provincial Conference, Bihar Landholder’s Association and Bihar Provincial Muslim League came together and addressed Andrew Fraser, the Lieutenant-Governor of Bihar and West Bengal, during his visit to Patna regarding their demand for separation.</p>\n<p>“Since this address was considered to be a representative view of both Bihari Muslim and Hindu literati as well as that of the provincial landholders, they claimed that the address was “unique and distinctive” as it did not “emanate from any particular section, caste, class or community,” but instead was “the humble and loyal representation of the views of the sentiments of the entire Bihari community,” Chakravartty writes in his thesis, noting that the address was well received by Fraser, who acknowledged the demand for a separate state.</p>\n<p>Finally, in December 1911, during the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a> Durbar, the British government announced that Bihar and Orissa would be carved out of Bengal on the occasion of George V’s coronation as the Emperor of India. The declaration was notified on March 22, 1912, and the two regions appeared as separate states on India’s map the next month.</p>\n</div> ",

The legislation says that “after emergency care, stabilisation and transfer of patient, if patient does not pay requisite charges, the healthcare provider shall be entitled to receive requisite fee and charges or proper reimbursement from the state government”.\\</p>\n<p>The Bill extends a total of 20 Rights to the citizens of the state.</p>\n<span><img src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/Jaipur-clash-with-doctors-4col-1.jpg?resize=600,413\"> Police lathicharge doctors during a protest in Jaipur on Monday. (Express photo by Rohit Jain Paras)</span>\n<p><strong>Doesn’t Rajasthan already have health schemes?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, other schemes do exist.</p>\n<p>Under the Ashok Gehlot government’s flagship Chiranjeevi Health Insurance Scheme, free treatment up to Rs 10 lakh is provided. This has been increased to Rs 25 lakh in the latest budget, which will be implemented from the next financial year. Under this scheme, the government paid as many as 34.77 lakh claims worth Rs 1,940 crore between April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Secondly, there is the Rajasthan Government Health Scheme for government employees, which includes ministers, current and former MLAs, etc.</p>\n<p>Third is the Nishulk Nirogi Rajasthan, which also includes the Free Medicine scheme. Under this, all OPD and IPD services in government hospitals, including the registration fee, are provided for free. It covers about 1,600 medicines, 928 surgicals and 185 sutures. As of December end, it had benefitted 8.6 crore patients at a cost of Rs 1,072 crore between March-December 2022.</p>\n<p>Four, there is the Free Test scheme which provides for up to 90 free tests in government hospitals attached with medical colleges, 56 tests in district, sub-district hospitals, and so on. Between March-December 2022, 2.93 crore persons had benefited from it.</p>\n<p><strong>So what was the need for the RTH?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Healthcare is close to the heart of Chief Minister Gehlot, who had come up with the Chiranjeevi scheme, and is pushing to develop Rajasthan as a model state when it comes to health. However, his government has often been panned over the implementation of the Chiranjeevi scheme, especially at the end of private hospitals.</p>\n<p>During the debate on the Bill in the Assembly, Health minister Parsadi Lal said, “It is true that despite having a Chiranjeevi card, hospitals sometimes ask a patient for money, to deposit an advance. I get a lot of complaints, and we have even made hospitals return such money…hence we are bringing this Bill.”</p>\n<p>As per the Bill, anyone found in contravention of the Act will be punishable with a fine of up to Rs 10,000 for the first contravention, and up to Rs 25,000 for the subsequent contraventions. However, many have pointed out that the penalty may be too low for hospitals.</p>\n<p>Second, with Congress and <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/\">BJP</a> taking turns to rule Rajasthan and both accusing each other of renaming and altering schemes, bringing an Act would ensure that subsequent governments abide by its provisions and extend free healthcare mandatorily.</p>\n<p>Third, CM Gehlot would hope to be remembered for his welfare schemes, with his legacy of numerous healthcare schemes at the top. The present Bill is a step in that direction.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the clause about emergency in the RTH?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>One of the most contentious issues of the RTH was emergency care, leading to protests by doctors.</p>\n<p>After being changed by the Select Committee, the clause that was eventually passed Tuesday states that people will have the right to emergency treatment and care for accidental emergency, emergency due to snake bite/animal bite and any other emergency decided by the State Health Authority under prescribed emergency circumstances.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Importantly, this can be availed without prepayment of requisite fee or charges for prompt and necessary emergency medical treatment and critical care, emergency obstetric treatment and care, by any public or private health institution qualified to provide such care or treatment according to their level of health care.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the Opposition’s objection to the Bill?</strong></p>\n<p>During the debate on the Bill Tuesday, the BJP’s opposition primarily centred on two points. It demanded that in case of private facilities, only multispecialty hospitals with 50 beds be included and that there should be a single forum for complaints.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf said, “If a cardiac patient reaches an eye hospital, how will he get treatment? Hence we demand that only multispecialty hospitals with 50 beds be included under the law.” The Health Minister said that this specification for private hospitals will be included in the Rules made as part of the Act.</p>\n<p>Saraf and Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore, both of whom held the health portfolio in the previous government and were part of the Select Committee for the Bill, demanded that the government incorporate these two points in the Bill itself.</p>\n<p>On the demand for a single window system for redressal, Rathore said: “Right now, you can complain against the doctors with the Medical Council, Consumer Court, under the Medical Protection Act, with the Human Rights Commission … there are 50 places where you can complain against a doctor.” Saraf said, “Now you are adding one more forum for complaints. Will the doctor practice or only occupy himself with redressal of complaints?”</p>\n<p><strong>Why are doctors protesting?</strong></p>\n<p>Dr Neeraj Damor, president, Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors (JARD), questioned the need for the RTH. “When you already have schemes such as Chiranjeevi which cover the majority of the population under existing rules, why bring RTH and impose it on doctors?” He said that there are several clauses doctors are still objecting to, including defining ‘emergency’, and “compelling doctors of one speciality to treat patients outside their speciality as part of emergency.”</p>\n<p>However, the government has repeatedly said that the definition of “emergency” was reworked only after consultations with doctor associations, while the second part will be addressed in the Rules which will be made subsequently, and hence there is no question of compelling doctors to treat outside their speciality.</p>\n<p>Sunil Chugh, president of IMA Rajasthan, said that the IMA has demanded inclusion of several clauses in the Bill. One of them lists nine “responsibilities and duties” that the patients and caretakers should have towards the healthcare facilities: be respectful to providers; avoid crowding with a patient; not to be abusive or with violent behaviour; timely meet financial responsibilities,” etc.</p>\n<p>Another clause lists as many as 17 “Rights of Health Care Providers,” such as “to be treated with respect by patients and the person attending the patient; to be duly informed when patients are seeking a second opinion; to get the tests done in-house or the nearest lab in case of an emergency to prevent delay in patient care; cost of treatment reimbursement must be within 15 days through a separate portal other than government health insurance schemes,” etc. Chugh says that the suggestions were received after a meeting with office bearers from across the state, and as these demands were not included, the Bill should have been dropped.</p>\n<p>However, government sources said the latest demands are an “addendum” to the doctors’ earlier demands, almost all of which have already been met, and accused the protesting doctors of constantly shifting goalposts so that the Bill is not passed in any form.</p>\n<p>“Earlier, the doctors’ objection was that they were not consulted before the formulation of the Bill. So we sat down with all the associations. They had two major objections: that emergency be defined properly, and that their representatives be included in the state and district health authorities which, they claimed, were dominated by bureaucrats and politicians,” an official said.</p>\n<p>“So we defined the term emergency as per their demand, and even removed the provision for the government nominating two members to state and district authorities in the Bill, and went as far as replacing it with a provision for IMA itself to nominate two representatives to district and state authorities. In the district committee, we also removed Zila Pramukh and three Pradhans of Panchayat Samiti. So we have in fact gone a step further than what they asked,” the official said.</p>\n<p>“Essentially, right now, the private hospitals act on their whims, like insisting on in-house investigation reports, declining to hand over files. The system lacks transparency and they often over-charge for various services. Once the citizens are made aware of their rights through the Act and the system becomes more transparent with the involvement of the government, then perhaps the hospitals won’t be able to mint as much money by charging deceptively. That’s the real reason behind the doctors’ protest,” the official alleged.</p>\n<p>The Bill empowers patients “to choose source of obtaining medicines or tests at all health care establishments”, which means that hospitals cannot insist on in-house medicines or tests.</p>\n<p>If a patient wishes to leave, they will have to be given “treatment summary in case of a patient leaving health care establishment against the medical advice,” or “to obtain treatment records and information from the treating health care establishments to seek second opinion from another health care professional or health care establishment.”</p>\n</div> ",

He is yet to be arrested by the authorities.</p><div><span>From the NYT</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/donald-trump-arrest-indictment-explained-8511419/\">How an indictment and arrest of Donald Trump could unfold</a></div>\n<h2><strong>What is the current case status?</strong></h2>\n<p>Under New York law, a person expecting an indictment can request a witness to appear on his behalf. The final decision to hear the witness rests with the grand jury. In light of this, Robert J. Costello, who was once a legal adviser to Michael Cohen, appeared before a Manhattan grand jury on Monday, at the request of Trump’s lawyers. Costello provided testimony attacking the credibility of the prosecution witness, while adding, “I told the grand jury that this guy couldn’t tell the truth if you put a gun to his head,” <em>The New York Times</em> reported.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/donald-trump-arrest-indictment-explained-8511419/\"><strong>Why is Trump facing arrest?</strong></a></h2>\n<p>Trump could be indicted or formally charged for covering up payments discreetly made to Daniels during his 2016 presidential campaign. According to <em>Reuters</em>, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg presented evidence to the grand jury about a $130,000 payment to Daniels in exchange for her silence about a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.</p>\n<p>A <em>BBC</em> report states that once the investigation is complete, the grand jury votes on criminal charges. But first, the Manhattan District Attorney will decide if charges are to be brought in. If a criminal case is initiated, this would be a first against a former US president. However, the next steps for the grand jury remain unclear.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the New York case is one of the several cases pending against Trump. Others include the Georgia Election interference probe, federal investigations into his role in the storming of the US Capitol in 2021, and the retention of classified documents after he left the White House.</p>\n<h3><strong>What are the possible charges against Trump?</strong></h3>\n<p>* In 2018, Cohen was arrested by the FBI following raids at his home and office. After this, he pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal Court to eight counts, including criminal tax evasion and campaign finance violations. According to a 2018 federal court filing in Cohen’s case, it was revealed that Trump had concealed the purpose of the “hush” payments made to Cohen by falsely stating they were for a legal retainer that did not exist.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In the present case, Trump could be charged with falsifying business records under Article 175 of the New York Penal Law. A conviction for the felony of bookkeeping fraud involves a sentence of up to four years. However, to prove this, prosecutors require evidence showing Trump caused his subordinates to make false entries in the company record, “with intent to defraud.” For the action to be a felony rather than a misdemeanour, the intention of committing, aiding, or concealing a “second crime” needs to be brought out.</p>\n<p><em>The NYT</em> has also reported that the DA’s office is considering invoking the campaign funding violations against him as the intended “second crime”.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/xi-jinping-power-play-in-moscow-vladimir-putin-russia-war-8510802/\">Power play in Moscow: What China hopes to gain from Xi’s meeting with Putin</a></div>\n<p>* Special counsel for the federal Justice Department, Jack Smith, is investigating matters related to “several hundred documents marked as classified” that Trump kept at his Florida club and home, despite leaving office. Moreover, he also resisted efforts by the Justice Department to turn them over, submitting only a few despite a court order. In August 2022, the FBI issued a search warrant and found 103 more documents in Trump’s possession.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>For this, Trump could face charges of unauthorized retention of national security documents. The FBI’s affidavit for searching Trump’s home also stated Section 793(e) of Title 18 of the Espionage Act as a charge against him, which pertains to “gathering, transmitting or losing defence information”. The stipulated punishment for this is up to 10 years per each classified document. But the prosecution must prove that Trump possessed the documents after leaving the White House and failed to comply when asked to return them. The documents should also relate to national defence and their disclosure should possibly harm the US or aid a foreign adversary.</p>\n<p>* Following the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, a committee was constituted, which accused Trump of attempted obstruction of an official proceeding under Section 1512 (C) of Title 18, which is punishable with up to 20 years imprisonment. The same law has been used to charge 300 other rioters who participated in the storming of the Capitol. However, in Trump’s case, the situation is complicated since he did not physically participate in the riot himself.</p>\n<p>The committee also referred to Section 2383 of Title 18, which criminalizes incitement, assistance, or aiding an insurrection against the authority and laws of the federal government, and said that Trump’s refusal to call off the rioters for hours corroborated this.</p>\n<p>* The District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia is investigating events relating to the 2020 Georgia state elections, where Trump attempted to “flip” President Joe Biden’s victory, as evidenced by a leaked phone call between Trump and Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger.</p>\n<p>Although, in the 2021 Georgia Code, most election violations are considered misdemeanours, there are still some charges which can be levelled against Trump, including Section 21-2-603, which criminalizes conspiring with another person to violate the provisions of the election code, and Section 21-2-604, which makes it a crime to make another person commit election fraud.</p>\n</div> ",

Here’s what such storms mean for the near and long term.</p><h2>How much rain has California received?</h2>\n<p>California has received 147% of average rainfall so far this season, according to the state Department of Water Resources.</p>\n<h2>Is the drought over?</h2>\n<p>The U.S. Drought Monitor, an initiative of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, deems California mostly drought free for the first time since 2020, with only the most arid regions in “severe” or “moderate” drought.</p>\n<p>Just a few months ago, a color-coded map created by the monitor, which partners with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, showed large globs of the state in the red of “extreme” drought or deep red of “exceptional” drought. The driest areas were largely concentrated in the state’s Central Valley agricultural lands.</p>\n<p>Experts warn that California and the West have not escaped longer-term conditions that, according to one study, created the region’s driest 22-year span in 12 centuries during the period of 2000 to 2021.</p>\n<p>As Arizona State University hydrologist Jay Famiglietti put it: “Say you are broke. If someone gives you a check for $100, and you have money for a day, you’re still broke.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n\n<div>Best of Explained</div><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/express-explained/\"><span>Click here for more</span></a> \n<p>During any normal 20-year period of the 20th century, about 10 years were wet and 10 years were dry – a sustainable ratio, said Thomas Harter of the University of California at Davis. During any normal 20-year period of the 20th century, about 10 years were wet and 10 years were dry – a sustainable ratio, Harter said. But in the past 25 years, only nine years were wet and 16 were dry, meaning the state needs seven more wet years to recover. And climate change points to future years that are likely to get warmer, exacerbating the increasingly dry climate.</p>\n<h2>How well has California captured storm water?</h2>\n<p>California’s 20th century infrastructure was designed to rush water from north to south for irrigation, human consumption and flood prevention without much concern for recharging underground aquifers. As a result, stormwater runoff largely flows out to sea.</p>\n<p>The state’s Water Supply Strategy released last year calls for creating storage space for up to 4 million acre-feet (4.9 billion cubic meters) of water, enough for 8 million households in a state of 40 million people. Most of that would be kept in groundwater or underground storage. But the plan is new, as is California’s way of thinking about how to adapt to drought with climate change. Although the state in recent years budgeted $8.7 billion for drought resilience, much of that destined for stormwater capture, the projects are mostly in their infancy.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<span><img src=\"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/03/cali.jpg?resize=600,334\"> A tree downed by high winds blocks Webster Street in Oakland, Calif., Tuesday, March 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez)</span>\n<h2>How does the rain affect wildfires?</h2>\n<p>This winter’s bountiful rainfall has already triggered considerable growth in grasses and scrub that will dry out by summer, leaving a larger, thicker fuel bed for wildfires, said Isaac Sanchez, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).</p>\n<p>Still, larger shrubs and trees retain moisture, making them less prone to burning as rapidly as they might when completely desiccated by drought, said Ed Clark, director of NOAA’s National Water Center.</p>\n<p>The heavy rains can create dangers around burn scars from previous wildfires. The denuded land becomes susceptible to mudslides.</p>\n<h2>What about the Colorado river?</h2>\n<p>The basin of the overused Colorado River, which runs through seven Western states and part of Mexico, received comparatively little rainfall from the atmospheric rivers. Although snowfall in the mountains was substantial, the long-term state of the river remains dire.</p>\n<p>Seven states form part of the 101-year-old Colorado River Compact dividing up the river’s water rights: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Those states are attempting to renegotiate the agreement with a federal request to reduce exploitation of the river by some 15% to 30%.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Despite the temporary reprieve, the state of California, which receives the most Colorado River water, is not likely to negotiate away its senior rights just because its reservoirs are relatively full at the moment, experts said. Reducing Colorado River water usage may require federal intervention.</p>\n<p>At least the snowfall saved Colorado River-<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-fed-and-what-role-does-it-play-us-economy-7824639/\">fed</a> Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the nation’s two largest reservoirs, from imminent danger of falling to “dead pool” levels – the point where a dam can no longer produce hydroelectric power nor deliver water downstream.</p>\n</div> ",

Prosecutors have signaled that an indictment is likely, but it is not a certainty. Before Trump can be charged, the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, must ask the grand jury that has been hearing evidence about the former president to vote on whether to charge him. A majority of jurors must agree to do so.</p><p>The timing of any potential indictment, arrest and arraignment is unknown and likely to remain so after a vote is conducted.</p>\n<p>The investigation, conducted by Bragg’s office, has been focused on Trump’s involvement in the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/donald-trump-arrest-porn-star-stormy-daniels-case-8507901/\"><strong>payment of hush money to a porn actress</strong></a> during the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Here’s what we know and don’t know about the course of the investigation and what might happen in the days ahead.</p>\n<h2>When might Trump be indicted?</h2>\n<p>The special grand jury that has been hearing testimony meets three afternoons a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. At least one more witness could be called before jurors are asked to vote, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>Once all the witnesses have testified, prosecutors must explain the criminal charges they are seeking to the jury of 23 Manhattan residents before asking them to vote. The earliest that could happen is Wednesday afternoon. A simple majority is all that is required to hand up an indictment.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n\n<div>Best of Explained</div><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/express-explained/\"><span>Click here for more</span></a> \n<h2>How soon could Trump be arrested?</h2>\n<p>If Trump is indicted, prosecutors would most likely work with his legal team to arrange his surrender in Manhattan. Within several days of his indictment, Trump, who lives at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, would travel to the city and turn himself in at the district attorney’s office in lower Manhattan. Hours later, he would be arraigned in a courtroom in the same building.</p>\n<p>Any indictment of Trump would almost certainly be sealed, and the charges would be kept secret from the public after the grand jurors vote. The unsealing of the indictment — and a public announcement of the charges against him — would coincide with his surrender and arraignment.</p>\n<p>However, there is some chance that Trump does not surrender — there have been differing reports on that possibility — which could kick off a more complex scenario.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Might Trump avoid indictment entirely?</h2>\n<p>Trump’s lawyers have met with prosecutors in hopes of warding off criminal charges, and while it is unlikely, there is a faint possibility that Bragg will opt not to seek an indictment (or that he will seek one and grand jurors will vote to reject it).</p>\n<p>But prosecutors have broad discretion during grand jury proceedings, and the defense has almost no role. Every available signal has suggested that an indictment is imminent.</p>\n<div><span>Also Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vladimir-putin-arrest-warrant-ukraine-war-crimes-international-criminal-court-8504268/\">ICC issues arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin for war crimes in Ukraine: What does this mean?</a></div>\n<h2>What might the charges be?</h2>\n<p>While it is clear that Manhattan prosecutors have been investigating the role Trump played in a hush-money payment to the porn actress, Stormy Daniels, the specific criminal charges prosecutors could seek are unknown — and will probably remain so even after he is indicted.</p>\n<p>People with knowledge of the matter have suggested the charges would stem from the falsification of business records that recorded reimbursements to Michael Cohen — Trump’s former lawyer and fixer and the prosecution’s star witness — as legal fees. Such a charge, combined with a second crime involving illegal campaign contributions, could rise to a low-level felony.</p>\n<h2>How do you arrest a former president?</h2>\n<p>Some of the routine steps that follow any felony arrest in New York would apply to the former president as they would to anyone else: He would be photographed, fingerprinted and read a standard Miranda warning offering him the right to remain silent.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>But because of Trump’s status as a former president — and his round-the-clock Secret Service detail — prosecutors are likely to make some accommodations. He could be held in an interview room instead of a cell; the investigators who process his arrest may forgo handcuffs.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement agencies around New York have also had discussions about how to prepare for the prospect of protests, which Trump called for explicitly on his social media site, Truth Social, over the weekend. A protest in Manhattan on Monday evening was sparsely attended.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n\n<h3>Will Trump be held in jail?</h3>\n<p>Because of the nature of the potential charges against Trump, the law does not allow prosecutors to seek to have him held on bail. And as a leading presidential candidate, he is far from a flight risk.</p>\n<p>Trump will almost certainly be released shortly after he is arraigned.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h3>What happens after that?</h3>\n<p>Once Trump has been charged, the case against him will probably be mired in protracted litigation. Should the matter eventually make it to trial, it could conceivably play out in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election — with Trump, the defendant, in the thick of his campaign.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Written by William K.

          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"5.246445497630331\" morss_score=\"72.04200750063914\">\n<p><strong>What is the case against Mehul Choksi?</strong></p>\n<p>Mehul Choksi is the owner of Gitanjali Group, a jewellery firm with 4,000 stores in India. He, along with his nephew <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-is-nirav-modi-punjab-national-bank-fraud-case-5064606/\">Nirav Modi</a>, are wanted in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam. Choksi and Modi are accused of conniving with bank officials to have fraudulent Letters of Undertaking (LoU) and Foreign Letters of Credit issued to companies owned by them. In this case, no securities were kept by the PNB before issuing the LoUs.</p><p>The case came to light in January 2018, when the PNB submitted a fraud report to the Reserve Bank of India. CBI filed an <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/fir-cognizable-offence-ipc-explained-7780266/\">FIR</a> in the case a week later. By this time, Choksi had already fled the country</p>\n<p>Choksi is wanted in India for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and financial misappropriation. An arrest warrant has been issued against him.</p>\n<p>Choksi had acquired the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 and was living there from 2018. However, he went missing from Antigua and Barbuda on May 23, 2021, and was soon caught in Dominica. While Choksi claimed he was kidnapped, he was charged with illegal entry by the police in Dominica. In May last year, Dominica dropped these charges against him.</p>\n<p><strong>What is an Interpol Red Notice</strong></p>\n<p>Criminals or suspects often flee to other countries to evade facing justice. A Red Corner Notice, or Red Notice (RN) alerts police forces across the world about fugitives who are wanted internationally.</p>\n<p>Interpol says “Red Notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>RNs contain information that helps identify wanted persons, such as their names, dates of birth, nationality, and physical attributes such as the colour of their hair and eyes, as well as pictures and biometric data such as fingerprints, if they are available. RNs also mention the crime(s) they are wanted for.</p>\n<p>An RN is only an international wanted persons’ notice; it is not an international arrest warrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Why was the Red Notice issued against Choksi?</strong></p>\n<p>The Red Notice was issued against Choksi in December 2018 on a request from the CBI and Enforcement Directorate. His appeals against the decision were rejected in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Why has it been revoked?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Welcoming the Interpol’s decision, Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal told ANI that the withdrawal of the Red Notice comes after the “genuine claim of kidnapping” by the fugitive diamantaire. “Ultimately, truth has prevailed as the kidnapping attempt of my client is not approved by the international community, RCN issued against my client by Interpol has been removed”.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the move mean for Choksi?</strong></p>\n<p>The removal of the Red Notice means Choksi can travel around the world freely without any fear of being arrested by law enforcement agencies. The exception is India, where he faces multiple cases. This also weakens India’s efforts to extradite him.</p>\n<p><strong>What has the CBI said?</strong></p>\n<p>The CBI said that the CCF’s decision is “based on mere imaginary conjunctures and unproven surmises”. It said the CCF has subsequently clarified to CBI that its decision in no manner has any determination on any guilt or innocence of Mehul Chinubhai Choksi for crimes he remains charged in India.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the reactions to the withdrawal of the Red Notice?</strong></p>\n<p>The Congress said that while the Opposition was being targeted by the Enforcement Directorate and CBI, the Central government’s “friend” was being let off. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said talk of patriotism by those giving “protection” to such people is a “joke”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In a tweet, former Congress chief <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a> said, “‘Vipaksh ko ED, CBI, Mitr ko rihaai’ (ED, CBI for the Opposition, let off for friend).” “‘Modani’ model matlab pehle looto, phir bin sazaa ke chooto’ (Modani model means first loot and then go scott-free without punishment),” he said.</p>\n<p>Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala stated, “Modi Govt ‘Red Faced’ India by failing to prevent Mehul Choksi’s removal from Interpol’s List of Red Corner Notices!”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, AAP’s Raghav Chadha also hit out the government for targeting the Opposition with fake cases, while Choksi lives scot-free.</p>\n</div> ",

In the Banco Popular case, alongside bonds, equity was also written off; the Credit Suisse-UBS deal brokered by the Swiss financial regulator FINMA entails a complete write-down of the bank’s AT1 bonds, even as equity shareholders are set to receive about 3 billion Swiss francs.</p>\n<p>The action reverses what is typically a settled principle of write-downs: shareholders take the hit ahead of bondholders. While AT1 securities are considered the most risky among bonds, in the right-to-payouts list, AT1 bondholders come after senior bondholders but are ahead of equity shareholders — who are theoretically exposed to losses upfront.</p>\n\n<p>Reuters reported that UBS CEO Ralph Hamers told analysts that the decision to write down the AT1 bonds to zero was taken by FINMA, so it would not create a liability for the bank. But the regulator’s action goes against the traditional flow of things and threatens to plunge European bond markets into turmoil.</p>\n<p><strong>Bond market impact</strong></p>\n<p>At nearly $130 trillion, the global bond market far outweighs the stock market in size, and plays an outsize role in the global financial system, especially in the way governments raise funds to manage their deficits. Rumblings in the bond markets could make it harder for other lenders to raise new AT1 debt, especially when the financial sector is facing tough times. AT1s, introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis as a bankable debt market instrument, pay higher interest as they carry greater risk than regular debt.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Following FINMA’s announcement of the CHF 16 billion (about $17.3 billion) write-down of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds, European and Asian AT1 bonds tanked on Monday. UBS’ AT1s with a 2025 call slid to around 85 cents on the dollar compared with 93 cents on Friday, according to Tradeweb data quoted by Reuters.</p>\n<p><strong>European vs US crisis</strong></p>\n<p>There are specific, and somewhat distinct, triggers for the unfolding banking sector crises on either side of the Atlantic. Credit Suisse was partly a victim of bond market losses, but multiple other factors were at play in its downfall: a poor governance record and chequered investment decision-making, which saw the bank lurching from scandal to scandal over much of the last decade, and it was repeatedly categorised as Europe’s weakest “systemically important” bank.</p>\n<p>In the US, the triggers were different. Over 90 per cent of deposits at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank were uninsured, and thereby prone to bank runs. These banks were also invested heavily in long-term government bonds — and when interest rates rose, the value of their bond portfolios declined. They sold some bonds to raise funds, and when these losses came to light, panicky depositors rushed to pull out.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>There was also an asset-liability mismatch in SVB’s case: being overly exposed to the same profile of funders and customers — venture capital funds and start-ups.</p>\n<p>Troubles in the banking sector and the wider bond market are likely to be high on the agenda of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday. This is especially important as analysts point to a soft landing of the economy as being less of a possibility today than recessionary risk.</p>\n\n<div>Best of Explained</div><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/express-explained/\"><span>Click here for more</span></a> \n<p><strong>Impact on Indian banks</strong></p>\n<p>The decision to write down Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds to zero after the lender’s takeover by UBS may contribute to a higher cost of capital for banks, including Indian lenders, S&amp;P Global Ratings said on Tuesday. The write-down will weigh on the pricing of such notes and spook investors, Citi analysts said in a note.</p>\n<p>In India, AT1 bonds of Yes Bank were written down in March 2020 after the Reserve Bank of India initiated a restructuring of the troubled lender. Since then, Indian banks have raised AT1 bonds at an up to 75 basis points premium over government bonds, Citi noted.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Some bankers, however, do not see a major impact on the fundraising capabilities of Indian banks through AT1 bonds — one reason for the optimism is that the spread between regular bonds and AT1 bonds in India is less than 150 basis points, while in the EU and the US, it is 200-250 bps. Jefferies said in a note that Indian lenders have “limited dependence” on such securities.</p>\n<p>S&amp;P noted that Indian lenders are capable of “enduring any potential contagion effects” emanating from the US banking turmoil and the Credit Suisse episode “given their manageable exposures” to global counterparts. “Strong funding profiles, a high savings rate, and government support are among the factors that bolster the financial institutions we rate,” the rating agency said, adding that domestic banks had sufficient buffers to withstand losses on their government securities portfolio due to rising interest rates.</p>\n</div> ",

The Hindu Kush region usually experiences deep earthquakes, originating at a depth of 100 km or below. Deep earthquakes, if sufficiently strong, are felt over large geographical areas, because in travelling radially upwards to the earth’s surface, they spread over great distances. The terrain in Afghanistan extending into northern India has lots of solid rocks which are conducive to wave propagation.</p>\n<p>However, precisely because they have to traverse long distances, deep earthquakes are also generally weaker, losing a substantial part of their energy during the travel. So even though the tremors continued for 15-20 seconds in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a> and adjoining areas, they are unlikely to have caused much damage.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is not the first time that northern India has been shaken prominently by earthquakes in Afghanistan. In 2015, about six months after the powerful Nepal earthquake, a 7.5-magnitude quake in roughly the same area in Afghanistan had rattled most of north India. It was a similar story in January 2018 as well. In all these instances, the earthquakes had originated more than 150 km below the surface.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake in southern Tajikistan, a couple of hundred km north from the location of Tuesday’s quake, last month was not felt anywhere in India because it was very shallow, originating just 11 km below the surface.</p>\n<p>The Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan experiences unique tectonic forces and is a site of frequent earthquakes. On one side it feels the forces of the Indian tectonic plate getting under the Himalayas, a phenomenon that is occurring throughout the Himalayan ranges. From the other side, the Eurasian plate is subducting into the Pamir mountain ranges. In addition, there are local faultlines as well.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Deep earthquakes also are more unlikely to be followed by aftershocks. No aftershocks were reported from Afghanistan on Tuesday. In contrast, the 7.8 earthquake in Turkey last month was followed by nearly a hundred big and small aftershocks.</p>\n</div> ",

Deep earthquakes tend to be felt over large distances, which is why tremors were experienced in Punjab, Rajasthan’s Jaipur, and Jammu and Kashmir.</p><p>The epicentre of the earthquake was near Jurm in northeastern Afghanistan, about 300 km north of Kabul, quite close to Afghanistan’s borders with Tajikistan, according to the USGS. This is an earthquake-prone region where six-plus earthquakes are not rare. A similar 6.1 magnitude earthquake had occurred very close to this place in 2018 as well, which again was felt through most of northern India.</p>\n<p>A 6.1 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan killed over 1,000 people last year.</p>\n<p><strong>How big is the earthquake?</strong></p>\n<p>How much damage an earthquake will cause depends on its depth and magnitude.</p>\n<p>Shallow earthquakes are generally more devastating because they carry greater energy when they emerge on the surface. Deeper earthquakes lose much of their energy by the time they come to the surface. The deeper quakes spread farther — the seismic waves move radially upwards to the surface — even as they lose energy while travelling greater distances, and hence cause less damage. Thus, the current tremors are unlikely to cause much damage in India.</p>\n<p>This earthqauke was of 6.5-magnitude. Magnitude is a measure of how big the waves are, while the strength refers to the energy it carries. Magnitude is measured on a logarithmic scale, which means the seismic waves produced by a magnitude 6 earthquake have 10 times higher amplitude than the ones produced by a magnitude 5 earthquake. The energy differential is even higher, 32 times for every change of 1 in magnitude.</p>\n<p><strong>Western Himalayas risky zone</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Western Himalayas continues to be the one of the most dangerous seismic zones in the world. Scientists say the Himalayan region, the 2500-km stretch from the Hindu Kush mountains to the end of Arunachal Pradesh, is due for a big earthquake, of a magnitude over 8 on Richter scale, anytime. This is because of the huge amount of energy stored along the faultlines due to the continuous interaction of different techtonic plates. The energy can be released only in the form of massive earthquakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Earthquakes remain unpredictable</strong></p>\n<p>Earthquakes continue to remain the most <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/turkey-syria-earthquakes-seismically-active-zone-the-science-of-quakes-8427982/\">common natural hazard that cannot be predicted</a></strong>. As such, no early warning systems can be developed.</p>\n<p>Theoretically, it is possible to offer a lead time of a few seconds between the time of the origin of the earthquake and the time it reaches the Earth’s surface. Seismic waves travel significantly slower than the speed of light — between 5 and 13 km per second. So if the earthquake is detected as soon as it is triggered, information about it can be related a few seconds ahead of it reaching the ground.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Such systems are already in use in some locations to issue alerts about earthquakes. However, these are not predictions. The alerts are issued post-event.</p>\n<p>Attempts to find reliable predictors to earthquakes have not been fruitful so far. Scientists have been able to map the areas that are earthquake prone, and are likely to generate earthquakes in future, but there is no way to predict when.</p>\n</div> ",

He fled India in January 2018, days before the CBI booked him and his nephew <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/nirav-modi-case-court-pulls-up-banks-for-not-complying-with-its-orders-8505604/\"><strong>Nirav Modi</strong></a> in the case. He had by then acquired the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda, and is since fighting the Indian government’s efforts to bring him back to the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Why was the RCN withdrawn?</strong></p>\n<p>A Red Notice, according to the Interpol, is “a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action”. The withdrawal of the RCN against Choksi — issued by the Interpol in 2018 — means he can now travel without restrictions anywhere in the world, except in India.</p>\n<p>Choksi had appealed against the notice earlier too, but his demand was rejected in 2020. <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cbi-seeks-restoration-of-red-notice-against-mehul-choksi-agency-statement-8510442/\">According to the CBI statement</a></strong>, in 2022, he approached the CCF, a separate body within Interpol that is not under the control of INTERPOL Secretariat and is mainly staffed by elected lawyers from different countries “to revise its earlier decision of 2020.” “…based on mere imaginary conjunctures and unproven surmises, a five member CCF chamber has taken a decision on deletion of Red Notice,” the CBI said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Choksi’s lawyer in India, Vijay Aggarwal, said on March 20, “Because of the efforts of the legal team and the genuineness of my client’s case, his RCN has been cancelled, and ultimately truth has prevailed.”</p>\n<p><strong>What charges does Choksi face in India?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Choksi is facing criminal proceedings by both CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED). The CBI had first named Choksi and his firms, including Gitanjali Gems, in 2018, based on a complaint by the PNB over the issuance of fraudulent Letters of Undertaking in their favour, causing losses to the bank.</p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-what-are-the-criminal-charges-that-mehul-choksi-is-facing-in-india-7333023/\">ED also subsequently filed a complaint alleging that Choksi</a></strong> and others were involved in money-laundering the proceeds of crime in overseas accounts. Choksi has been booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and other sections pertaining to cheating, criminal conspiracy of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.</p>\n<p>A similar case was also filed against Choksi’s nephew <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-is-nirav-modi-punjab-national-bank-fraud-case-5064606/\">Nirav Modi</a>, alleging that they both colluded with some staffers of PNB to perpetrate the multi-crore fraud.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In December last year, the CBI booked Choksi in a fresh case of loan fraud. In the new case, he has been accused of defrauding and diverting loan funds to the tune of over Rs 6,700 crore.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the status of extradition efforts?</strong></p>\n<p>Choksi has claimed that by virtue of acquiring the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda, he has ceased to be an Indian citizen. Choksi acquired Antiguan citizenship just over a month before he fled India in January 2018, making use of the country’s Citizenship by Investment (CIP) programme, under which an individual can acquire an Antigua and Barbuda passport by investing USD 100,000.</p>\n<p>Indian authorities, however, say that while Choksi may have surrendered his passport, <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-dominica-dropped-case-mehul-choksi-india-efforts-bring-him-back-7932348/\">India has not accepted this</a></strong>, and a certificate of surrender of passport has not been issued to him.</p>\n<p>India had made efforts to bring him back when Choksi was arrested in Dominica in May 2021 on charges of illegal entry. Choksi had then alleged he was honey trapped and then abducted by “Indian agents”, who brought him to Dominica from Antigua and Barbuda. But the Dominican court granted him bail and allowed him to return to Antigua. About a year later, in May 2022, charges against Choksi were dropped by Dominica.</p>\n</div> ",

And United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Xi’s visit to Moscow was an indication that “China feels no responsibility to hold the Kremlin accountable for the atrocities committed in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/russia-invasion-ukraine-history-creation-explained-7791147/\">Ukraine</a>”.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What does Xi hope to achieve by this visit to meet Putin?</strong></p>\n<p>The China-Russia relationship matters to Beijing for several reasons.</p>\n<p>One, from the point of view of security, it is imperative for Beijing to maintain both outreach and cordial relations with Moscow.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/arrest-warrant-putin-power-icc-russian-president-8505138/\">Arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin: What powers does the ICC have against the Russian president</a></div>\n<p>It must be remembered that the former Soviet Union and China had a history of both cooperation and violent clashes during the Cold War. Some objective conditions have not changed despite the fall of the Soviet Union and its successor’s considerably less significant global political and economic influence — Russia is still China’s largest neighbour, a major source of military technology, and continues to exercise influence in the former Soviet states that border China’s troubled west. Additionally, Russia is now a major source of hydrocarbon energy as well as a market for China’s manufacturing and technology.</p>\n<p>Just as importantly, Xi Jinping sees in Vladimir Putin an ally in the opposition to Western liberal ideas and a US-led global order.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The Chinese under Xi meant every word when they declared a partnership with “no limits” during Putin’s visit to Beijing in early February 2022 on the eve of his invasion of Ukraine. To the Chinese, Western sanctions against Russia are an example of what a new Chinese document on their Global Security Initiative calls “abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction”.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese call for the International Criminal Court (ICC) “to take an objective and just position, respect the jurisdictional immunity of a head of state under international law, prudently exercise its mandate in accordance with the law, interpret and apply international law in good faith”, might actually find several takers across the world — no matter the violation of international law that the Ukraine invasion represents.</p>\n<p>The same Chinese statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on March 20 also declared, “China will uphold an objective and fair position on the Ukraine crisis and play a constructive role in promoting talks for peace,” essentially negating the narrative of an unjust war against Ukraine and portraying Xi’s visit to Moscow as any regular bilateral state visit.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>While the Chinese are no doubt constantly calculating the costs of Russia’s actions to themselves — they cannot have been too pleased with Putin’s visit to occupied Mariupol late on Saturday, for example — Xi sees value in showing the non-Western world that there is an alternative to American power and ideas of how the world should be run.</p>\n<p><strong>Does China want the war to end? Does it have influence on Putin enough to get him to stop?</strong></p>\n<p>Beijing is unlikely to want an end to the Russian war in Ukraine for several reasons.</p>\n<p>First, being tied down in Ukraine has the effect of weakening Russia militarily, economically, and politically. This is a vacuum that China can step into, especially in Eurasia — in September last year, for example, China offered security guarantees to Kazakhstan during Xi’s visit there, and made Belarus its second “all-weather strategic partner” after Pakistan.</p>\n<p>Second, a prolonged conflict in Ukraine means that the West’s, and in particular the United States’, attention and resources are diverted — and this the Chinese see as a good thing. From Beijing’s point of view, it weakens the focus on and reduces the resources for any potential Western intervention on China’s eastern seaboard, particularly in the scenario of a crisis over <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-china-problem-nancy-pelosi-visit-taiwan-8066503/\">Taiwan</a>.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Third, a continuing crisis in Ukraine offers opportunities for international messaging about the relative rise in Chinese power vis-à-vis both the Russians and Americans. Clearly, Russia’s regional and global stature has taken a hit from what it has done and what it is unable to do — that is, to prosecute a quick end to the conflict.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, just as China’s role in helping Iran and Saudi Arabia restore diplomatic ties was intended to showcase Beijing’s rising influence and the decline of the US in the Middle Eastern region, the inability of the Ukrainians to expel the Russian invaders despite Western support can be used to send a signal in Europe.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-saudi-deal-what-the-gambit-can-mean-for-china-west-asia-and-india-8502096/\">Iran-Saudi deal: What the gambit can mean for China, West Asia, and India</a></div>\n<p>There is, therefore, little reason for Xi to try and persuade Putin to stop the war.</p>\n<p>If anything, China’s political support at forums such as the United Nations and elsewhere has been crucial to Russia building a case for the legitimacy of the war. We might even see over time indirect Chinese military support to Russia. The agreement between Belarus and China earlier this year has sections on industrial production, joint R&amp;D and defence cooperation — which could well allow for potential weapons production and transhipment to Russia.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p><strong>Are the US and China, too, in talks over the war?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Washington and Beijing have a conversation ongoing about the conflict in Ukraine, but it is unlikely that they can come to any sort of meeting ground in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>The two nations have fundamentally different interests on this and other issues, and more often than not, these are opposing interests. These differences are ideological and deep-rooted, and the recent American shooting down of a Chinese surveillance balloon in US airspace suggests that tensions in the US-China relationship are only set to grow.</p>\n<p>Even if their interests were to align temporarily, Xi has too close a relationship with Putin — and sees greater value in a Russian bulwark against the West — to try and actively promote Washington’s brief. It is also not clear what the Americans could offer China in return.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the war affect China?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the war brings costs to China — not just economic ones but political ones, too, especially from the major Western nations that are also big markets for Chinese manufacturing and sources for high technology.</p>\n<p>But these are costs that the Chinese economy appears large enough to bear, especially when it is able to procure oil at deep discounts from Russia, and has had its own version of technological self-reliance programmes underway for decades. China is also able to use its economic influence to carry out trade in its own currency with Russia and other sanctioned regimes — Iran, for example.</p>\n<p>But the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on China is not just external and economic but also internal.</p>\n<p>The conflict confirms Xi’s claims in recent times in several important domestic documents and speeches that China “is facing global changes of a magnitude not seen in a century”. Calling attention to a challenging external environment is Xi’s way of reminding the Chinese people of the perils of “[v]arious ‘black swan’ and ‘gray rhino’ events” and the necessity of supporting the ruling Communist Party and Xi himself to help them deal with these challenges.</p>\n<p>An unstable external environment and its economic consequences can also be used to justify both China’s current economic difficulties in the wake of the pandemic as well as Xi’s continuing hold over the reins of power as being essential for national stability and recovery.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Jabin T Jacob is Associate Professor, Department of International Relations and Governance Studies, and Director, Centre for Himalayan Studies, Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR. </strong></em></p>\n</div> ",

CJI Chandrachud was one of the three judges along with then CJI Dipak Misra and Justice A M Khanwilkar (retd) who had agreed to hear the case.</p>\n<p>The case has now been listed after five years.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the Centre’s stand?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In its 2018 affidavit, the government had <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/hanging-most-suitable-mode-of-execution-centre-to-supreme-court-5150538/\"><strong>argued</strong></a> that death by hanging was the only “viable” option to execute a death warrant. However, the government also sought additional time to examine the methods followed in other countries.</p>\n<p>In its 187th report in 2003, the Law Commission of India recommended that Section 354(5) of the CrPC should be amended by providing an alternative mode of execution of death sentence by “lethal injection until the accused is dead”.</p>\n<p>The report suggested that it should be the discretion of the judge to pass appropriate orders regarding the mode of execution of death sentence and to hear the convict on the question of mode of execution of death sentence before passing the discretionary order.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the practice in other countries?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>According to Amnesty International, 55 countries around the world have the death sentence on the books. While death by hanging is still the most prevalent form of execution, especially in the former British colonies, other modes are followed in some countries.</p>\n<p>In the United States, for example, an intravenous lethal injection is given in every state (27 states and American Samoa) that allows the death penalty. Electrocution is a secondary method in some states. Execution by firing squad is employed in China, and Saudi Arabia uses beheading apart from other methods.</p>\n<p>In India, The Air Force Act, 1950, The Army Act 1950, and The Navy Act 1957 say that execution has to be carried out either by hanging by the neck until death or by being shot to death.</p>\n</div> ",

I thank the IMF &amp; our international partners for support,” Wickremesinghe posted on Twitter early on Tuesday (March 21).</p><p>While the IMF package is hardly sufficient — the first tranche is $33 million — to tide over Sri Lanka’s crisis, it will help the country restore its credibility with international private creditors, as referenced by Wickremesinghe in his tweet.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/mundra-petrochem-adani-suspended-8507960/\">What is Adani’s Mundra Petrochem project, why has work on it been suspended?</a></div>\n<p>The Board’s green light comes at a time when Wickremesinghe is under fire from Sri Lanka’s main opposition parties as well as from civil society groups and trade unions who led last year’s Aragalaya Movement that led to a dramatic change in the country’s political leadership, and catapulted Wickremesinghe to the top job.</p>\n<p>Wickremesinghe has been accused of using high-handed methods to contain the protests, including the arbitrary arrests of a number of activists. He has also put off holding local body elections citing the lack of funds, though opposition parties believe the postponement was due to Wickremesinghe’s lack of confidence that his side — which comprises the ousted Rajapakasas and their party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna — would able to win.</p>\n<p>The assurance from bilateral donors that they would support Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring was a precondition that Sri Lanka had to meet to unlock the arrangement with the IMF. Wickremesinghe had promised the country that this would happen before December 2022, then pushed the deadline further as China played hard to get.</p>\n<p>Finally, on March 7, Wickremesinghe was able to tell Parliament that the Chinese Exim Bank had sent the government a “new letter” of support. In January, the Exim Bank had said it was ready to observe a two-year moratorium on Sri Lanka’s debt to it.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>This time, according to a report by Reuters, the letter from the Bank reiterated the two-year moratorium, and also offered to negotiate the specifics of debt-treatment in the coming months.

It is essentially a non-technical summary of the previous reports, which were released between 2018 and 2022, and sets out possible policies and measures that might help stave off the worst consequences of climate change.</p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaways from the report</strong></p>\n<p>The new report lays out the present impact of soaring global temperature and imminent ramifications in case the planet continues to get warmer.</p>\n<p>Due to the current global warming levels, almost every region across the planet is already experiencing climate extremes, an uptick in deaths due to heatwaves, reduced food and water security and damage to ecosystems, causing mass extinction of species on land and in the ocean.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Moreover, “vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to climate change are being disproportionately affected,” the report said. It added that more than three billion people live in areas that are “highly vulnerable” to climate change — people living in these regions were “15 times more likely to die from floods, droughts and storms between 2010-2020 than those living in regions with very low vulnerability”.</p>\n<p>Things can get worse if the world crosses the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature limit, a target agreed to in the Paris Agreement. This would result in an unpredictable global water cycle, drought and fires, devastating floods, extreme sea level events and more intense tropical cyclones.</p>\n<p>“We are already at approximately 1.1 degree Celsius over pre-industrial level temperatures. What it simply means is that any additional warming is going to have an adverse impact. So there are going to be losses and damages on different systems. In this report, we talk of loss and damages to biodiversity, livelihood, water security, energy security etc.,” Professor Joyashree Roy, one of the 93 authors of the Synthesis report, said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>According to the scientists involved in writing the report, India would also face these dire consequences of global warming and needs to take immediate action to curb the temperature.</p>\n<p>Aditi Mukherjee, another author of the report, said, “Even though our per capita emissions are less, and we have historically, much less responsibility. But the reality is India is at the forefront of impacts. We simply cannot say that because we haven’t emitted much, we are not the ones to take action. I think the report makes it clear. Everybody has to take action according to their national context and circumstances urgently.”</p>\n<p>Given the present scale, scope and pace of global action, it’s most likely that Earth would overshoot this critical warming threshold somewhere in the following decade. The report categorically states that despite some advancements towards curtailing the greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, “adaptation gaps exist, and will continue to grow at current rates of implementation.” Some of the barriers to adaptation have been limited resources, lack of private sector and citizen engagement, low climate literacy, lack of political commitment and low sense of urgency.</p>\n<p>But there is still hope of arresting the rising global temperature within the 1.5 degree Celsius limit. In his address to the media, Guterres said, “Today’s <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-change-report-global-warming-7795268/\"><strong>IPCC report</strong></a> is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time-bomb. It is a survival guide for humanity. As it shows, the 1.5-degree limit is achievable. But it will take a quantum leap in climate action. This report is a clarion call to massively fast-track climate efforts by every country and every sector and on every timeframe.”</p>\n<p>The Synthesis Report underlines the requirement of climate-resilient development, which is finding ways to adapt to climate change or reduce greenhouse gas emissions that provide wider benefits. It further mentions that to be effective, these measures must be rooted in our diverse values, world views and knowledge around the globe — including Indigenous knowledge.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Apart from highlighting the urgent need of limiting the use of fossil fuel, the report urges governments and policymakers to increase finance to climate investments, expand the clean energy infrastructure, reduce nitrogen pollution from agriculture, curtail food waste, adopt measures to make it easier for people to lead low-carbon lifestyles and much more.</p>\n<p>Madeleine Diouf Sarr, Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group, said, “We know what the solutions are. Renewables, storage, electrification – they are already gaining a place in many parts of the world. But not enough. We need to move faster, with rich countries leading the way. It is disappointing that climate finance growth has slowed since 2018 when it should have accelerated. The largest gaps are in the developing world. But so too are the largest opportunities.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“We must shift these flows and increase access to finance to advance our collective prosperity and reach net zero. Since the last round of IPCC reports, science has progressed and we can see that the risks we face – drought, rising seas, floods – are happening, and will happen, at lower levels of warming. We must halve our emissions in this decade and limit warming to 1.5°C. We must bend the emissions curve down, global emissions need to peak before 2025.”</p>\n</div> </div>\n",

NSA “empowers the state to detain a person without a formal charge and without trial”.</p>\n<p>Under the Act, a person is taken into custody to prevent them from acting in any manner prejudicial to “the security of the state” or for “maintenance of the public order”. It is an administrative order passed either by the Divisional Commissioner or the District Magistrate (DM) – and not detention ordered by police based on specific allegations or for a specific violation of the law.</p>\n<p>Even if a person is in police custody, the District Magistrate can slap NSA against them. Or, if a person has been granted bail by a trial court, they can be immediately detained under the NSA. If the person has been acquitted by the court, the same person can be detained under the NSA. The law takes away an individual’s constitutional right to be produced before the magistrate within 24 hours, as is the case when the accused is in police custody. The detained person also does not have the right to move a bail application before a criminal court.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What are the grounds for detention?</h2>\n<p>NSA can be invoked to prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India, relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India. Among others, it can also be applied to prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supply and services essential to the community.</p>\n<p>An individual can be detained without a charge for a maximum period of 12 months. The detained person can be held for 10 to 12 days in special circumstances without being told the charges against them.</p>\n<h2>What is the protection available under the Act?</h2>\n<p>The Indian Constitution allows both preventive detention and the right of protection against arrest and detention in certain cases, enshrined under Article 22 of the Constitution. However, Article 22(3) provides that the rights available to an arrested person will not be applicable in case of preventive detention, thus an exception is carved out.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>One crucial procedural safeguard under the NSA is granted under Article 22(5), where all the detained persons have the right to make an effective representation before an independent advisory board, which consists of three members; and the board is chaired by a member who is, or has been, a judge of a high court. Notably, in a 2021 investigation of <em><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com\">The Indian Express</a></em> it was found that in all the 120 cases before the Allahabad High Court in the previous three years, the board upheld the detention.</p>\n<div><span>Express Investigation</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/detention-despite-bail-why-district-magistrates-love-the-nsa-7260430/\">Detention despite bail: Why District Magistrates love the NSA</a></div>\n<p>The DM who passes the detention order is protected under the Act: no prosecution or any legal proceeding can be initiated against the official who carries out the orders. Therefore, the writ of habeas corpus is the available remedy under the Constitution against the state’s power of taking people into custody under the NSA. Therefore, a <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/produce-amritpal-singh-habeas-corpus-in-hc-8506884/\">habeas corpus petition has been filed in Singh’s case</a></strong> in Punjab and Haryana High Court by Imaan Singh Khara, the legal advisor of Waris Punjab De.</p>\n<h2>What the top court says</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court in earlier cases had held that to prevent “misuse of this potentially dangerous power, the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed”, and “meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards” has to be ensured.</p>\n<h2>What is the criticism against NSA?</h2>\n<p>Nitin Kaushal, an advocate practising in the Punjab and Haryana High Court at <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/chandigarh/\">Chandigarh</a>, told<em> The Indian Express</em> that human rights groups have said in the past that the Act vitiates Article 22 of the Constitution and various provisions under the CrPC that safeguard the interest of an arrested person, namely that the arrested person should be informed regarding the ground of arrest and his right to consult a legal practitioner.</p>\n<p>Further, under the CrPC, the arrested person has to be produced before the nearest Magistrate within 24 hours, but the NSA carves out an exception. Some human rights groups argue that it is often misused by authorities to silence political opponents or those who are critical of the government. There have been calls for the Act to be repealed or amended to prevent its abuse.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>But there is an opposing view as well. Kaushal says the Act cannot be construed to be a draconian law as it protects the larger interest of the state, and is therefore likely to stay.</p>\n</div> ",

In a letter issued in 2015, it said pensions would be revised with effect from July 01, 2014, and said the pension would be reset every five years.</p>\n<p>In keeping with that, the union cabinet in December last year had approved revision of pension of Armed Forces pensioners and family pensioners under OROP with effect from July 1, 2019.</p>\n<p>This meant that the pension of the past pensioners would be reset based on the average of minimum and maximum pensions of the defence forces retirees of the calendar year 2018 in the same rank with the same length of service.</p>\n<p>All Armed Forces Personnel who retired till June 30, 2019, were to be covered under this revision, which will include more than 25.13 lakh (including over 4.52 lakh new beneficiaries) Armed Forces pensioners/family pensioners. The benefit would also be extended to family pensioners, including war widows and disabled pensioners.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>At that time, the government had said that arrears will be paid in four half-yearly instalments, except for family pensioners — including those in receipt of special/liberalised family pension and Gallantry Award Winners — who will be paid arrears in one instalment.</p>\n<p>The arrears are the amount calculated between July 2019 and December 2022, when the revised OROP was not under implementation but was supposed to be.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/vienna-convention-high-commission-london-8508253/\">Vandalism by pro-Khalistan protestors at Indian High Commission in London: What is the Vienna Convention, invoked by MEA</a></div>\n<p>Accordingly, an amount of Rs 28,138 crore was included in the defence pensions budget for 2023-24 to meet this requirement.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Why is there an issue with OROP arrears?</h2>\n<p>After the government’s December 2022 decision — further reiterated by a government order issued in January this year — a group of ex-servicemen moved the apex court seeking that the arrears be paid in a single instalment instead of four instalments.</p>\n<p>The January order stated that the OROP arrears would be paid in four half-yearly instalments.</p>\n<p>The ex-servicemen in its plea said the Centre, by issuing this order, <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/one-rank-one-pension-ex-service-personnel-supreme-court-explained-7823358/\">subverted the apex court’s March 2022 order</a></strong>, in which it had said that arrears payable to all eligible pensioners of the armed forces shall be computed and paid over accordingly within a period of three months.</p>\n<div><span>From Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/plan-laid-2-weeks-ago-mann-met-shah-for-central-forces-waited-for-g20-meets-to-end-8505632/\">Amritpal Singh case | Plan laid 2 weeks ago: Mann met Shah for Central forces, waited for G20 meets to end</a></div>\n<p>Subsequently, the Supreme Court earlier this month asked the defence ministry to withdraw the order. It had said the communication was “directly contrary” to its verdict of last year that had asked for the clearing of all arrears within three months.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court’s Monday directives to the government on new deadlines come against this backdrop.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What are the Centre’s issues with clearing OROP arrears in one go?</h2>\n<p>As per officials in the government, the cabinet note which was approved by the union cabinet last year had mentioned that instalments be cleared in four instalments, barring exceptions.</p>\n<p>While the government did make an appropriation of 28,138 crores in the budget for 2023-24 for payment of OROP arrears, officials explained this does not mean that this entire budget is available to the government for a lump sum payment.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>They said for every instalment paid, the Ministry of Finance will have to balance cash inflows and outflows — in the absence of which the government might need to go for additional borrowings to fill the deficit. Currently, the government is not in favour of such a move.</p>\n<h2>What is the way forward?</h2>\n<p>As per government data, around Rs 57,000 crore has been spent (Rs 7,123 crore per year) in eight years in the implementation of OROP.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>While the Supreme Court came down heavily on the government for submitting its reply in a sealed cover, it gave the government three separate deadlines for the clearing of dues by February next year. The phased deadline likely gives the government a breather in planning the finances related to disbursing OROP arrears, as against clearing it all together.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>While the instalments may not be divided into three equal amounts, it will still have some time to arrange for the second instalment of arrears after it pays the first by April 30. With the Centre earlier planning to clear all dues by March 15, the new deadlines also offer it an extra period of 1.5 months to clear the first instalment.</p>\n</div> ",

Though the accused(s) completed around 4-5 years of their sentences in the CBI case, Special Judge Ashwani Kumar Sarpal, who was hearing the case, said the court was “helpless”.</p><div><span>Also Read in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/kerala-high-court-a-raja-election-null-void-dalit-christian-8508351/\">Kerala HC declares A Raja’s election null and void: Can Christians, Muslims claim SC status?</a></div>\n<p>In doing so, the court rejected the accused’s argument alleging double jeopardy and said that “to operate as a bar of double jeopardy, the second prosecution and consequential punishment must be for the same offense”. If the two offences are distinct then the ban under Section 300 CrPC cannot be invoked, the court stated, while distinguishing between the 2012 CBI case involving “cheating, misappropriation and the criminal misconduct of the public servant while discharging official duty” from the ED’s 2021 money laundering case.</p>\n<h2>What is double jeopardy?</h2>\n<p>“Double jeopardy” comes from the Latin maxim “Nemo bis punitur pro eodem delicto”, which means that no one can be tried for the same offence twice. It has existed since the days of the Greeks and Romans, even finding a mention in the Justinian code, Canon law, Common Law, and the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>In India, this doctrine existed even before the Constitution came into being. A case in point would be the now-repealed General Clauses Act, of 1897 and Section 300 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1973, which says that a person once convicted or acquitted cannot be tried for the same offence. In its 2022 ruling in ‘T.P. Gopalakrishnan vs. State of Kerala,’ the Supreme Court went so far as to say that Section 300 bars the trial of a person not just for the same offence but also for any other offence on the same facts.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/vienna-convention-high-commission-london-8508253/\">Vandalism by pro-Khalistan protestors at Indian High Commission in London: What is the Vienna Convention, invoked by MEA</a></div>\n<p>The doctrine of double jeopardy is enshrined in the Indian Constitution under Article 20 (2), which says, “No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.” It guarantees immunity from double punishment and bars a second prosecution only where the accused has been both prosecuted and punished for the same offence previously, as held by the Supreme Court in its 1954 ruling in ‘Venkataraman SA vs. Union of India’.</p>\n<p>However, in its 1996 ruling in ‘AA Mulla vs State of Maharashtra’, the apex court held that Article 20(2) does not bar subsequent trials if the ingredients of the offences in the previous and subsequent trials are distinct. Moreover, there are certain conditions for the application of Article 20 (2).</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What are the conditions for the application of Article 20(2)?</h2>\n<p>It states:</p>\n<p>1) There must have been previous proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>2) The person must have been prosecuted in the previous proceedings.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>3) The conviction or acquittal in the previous proceeding must be in force at the time of the second trial.</p>\n<p>4) The offence which is a subject matter of the second proceeding must be the same as that of the first proceeding for which the accused was prosecuted and punished.</p>\n<p>5) The “offence” must be an offence as defined in Section 3(38) of the General Clauses Act which defines it as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force. The prosecution must also be valid and not null, void, or abortive.</p>\n<p>6) The subsequent proceeding must be a fresh proceeding where an accused is being prosecuted for the same offence twice. Hence, this clause does not apply when the later proceedings are a continuation of the previous proceedings, nor does it bar a retrial on appeal with a direction to frame charges, provided the retrial is for the same offence or offence as the original trial.</p>\n<h2>Why did the court allow ED’s case after 11 years?</h2>\n<p>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act does not provide for a limitation period for money laundering. This indicates that the law laid down in Section 468 of the CrPC, which states that there is no limitation period for offences punishable with three years imprisonment or more, will apply.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In this case, the court observed that the accused were nearing the completion of their sentence when the “ED suddenly filed the present complaint under the PMLA Act” on March 30, 2021, for the commission of offences under Section 4 read with Section 3. The former deals with punishment for money laundering, stipulating a minimum of three years imprisonment, while the latter defines “money laundering”.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/in-orop-case-cji-refuses-to-accept-sealed-cover-why-did-he-do-so-8508451/\">In OROP case, CJI Chandrachud refuses to accept ‘sealed cover’: Why did he do so?</a></div>\n<p>That the ED registered its Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) on December 17, 2009, and took about 11 years to file the complaint in court was also observed by the court and contested by the accused. “No explanation has been given in the complaint by the ED why it took several years to file the same in the court. No doubt, there is no limitation period for filing the complaint in the court by the ED under PMLA Act but certainly, in the present situation, it can be said that the ED slept over the matter for several years and suddenly come to the court to harass the accused persons and to upset their settled lives and has caused some prejudice to them,” the court observed.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>While the accused pleaded for leniency on grounds of double jeopardy and delay in ED filing the complaint, the court said that the wording of Section 4 of the PMLA Act seeks mandatory rigorous punishment of at least three years and the accused can’t be given the benefit of Probation of Offenders Act.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>The court also acknowledged the possibility of imposing a concurrent sentence, had the ED filed its complaint during the pendency of the CBI case. However, it said that it was not bound to do so, saying, “No doubt, this strong possibility of awarding concurrent sentences now has been snatched from the accused persons due to delayed complaint filed by ED but there was no limitation for filing the present complaint case.”</p>\n</div> ",

Here is why.</p><div><span>Explained </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-garbage-is-piling-up-in-the-streets-of-france-8498519/\">More than 7,000 tonnes of garbage piling up on Paris streets: What’s happening in France?</a></div>\n<h2>What changes to the pension system does Macron want to make?</h2>\n<p>The legislation raises the retirement age by two years to 64. The change will be implemented gradually, with the age increased by three months each year starting from this September, until 2030. Some workers in jobs deemed physically or mentally arduous will maintain the right to retire earlier than most of the working population.</p>\n\n<p>From 2027, most workers will have to make social security contributions over 43 years rather than 42 years in order to draw a full pension. This was already foreseen in a 2014 reform but Macron is accelerating the pace of transition.</p>\n<p>\nIn comparison, the United States is slowly raising its retirement age to 67, while Britain has announced plans to raise the state pension age to 68 by somewhere between 2037 and 2039.</p><h2>Why does the government say change is needed?</h2>\n<p>Macron’s government says reform is necessary to keep the pension budget in the black. Failure to act would see the pension system record an annual deficit of 13.5 billion euros by 2030, the government forecasts.</p>\n<p>The principal measures were initially seen generating 17.7 billion euros in additional contributions by 2030. The government calculated that “accompanying measures” to smooth the way would cost 4.8 billion euros, creating a 0.3 billion euros surplus in 2030.</p>\n<p>However, additional sweeteners raised this cost to 6 billion euros, leaving the government to find further last-minute savings and extra contributions to balance the budget. France’s pension system costs nearly 14% of GDP, the third highest within the OECD behind Italy and Greece.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Why is pension reform such a delicate task in France?</h2>\n<p>The pension system is a cornerstone of France’s cherished model of social protection. It is founded upon an obligatory contributory pension scheme and upon solidarity between generations. In other words, the contributions of those who are currently working directly fund the pensions of those now in retirement.</p>\n<p>Individuals can make voluntary contributions into savings products to top-up their eventual pension through the state-run system, but private pension funds like those common in Britain and the United States do not exist.</p>\n<div><span>Explained Global </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/turmoil-in-israel-8478880/\">Turmoil in Israel: Pushback in the streets as Netanyahu targets judiciary</a></div>\n<p>Past presidents including Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac met similarly fierce resistance from trade unions and on the street when seeking to change the pension system.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>Macron’s decision to ram through the pension legislation without a vote has infuriated opponents and triggered pockets of violent unrest.</p>\n<p>The government faces a vote of no-confidence in parliament. The motion is expected to fail, leaving the government to fight another day, while trade unions promise to keep up their battle. If unexpectedly the no-confidence vote is passed, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne would tender her government’s resignation in the hours that followed.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>Macron would have to form a new government with no working majority in parliament and remain reliant on a deeply divided mainstream centre-right for support. He could call a referendum on the pension reform and risk it becoming a plebiscite during his presidency. Or he could dissolve parliament and call snap elections, a move observers predict would only weaken him further in the National Assembly.</p>\n</div> ",

Chinese officials have framed the meeting partly as a mission to promote constructive talks between Russia and Ukraine, even though US officials have been skeptical of Xi’s recent efforts to become a global peacemaker.</p>\n<p>Here are five things to know about the relationship between China and Russia:</p>\n<h2><b>Are China and Russia allies?</b></h2>\n<p>China and Russia are not formal allies, meaning they have not committed to defend each other with military support. But the two countries are close strategic partners, a relationship that deepened during the war in Ukraine as Russia became increasingly isolated from many other countries.</p>\n<p>Chinese officials have said the current relationship is at a “historic high.”</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-saudi-deal-what-the-gambit-can-mean-for-china-west-asia-and-india-8502096/\">Iran-Saudi deal: What the gambit can mean for China, West Asia, and India</a></div>\n<p>The partnership is fueled by a shared goal of trying to weaken U.S. power and influence.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The relationship between China and Russia has not always been so warm. The two sides were fierce adversaries in the 1960s and clashed in 1969 over disputed territory along their border, raising fears at the time of a nuclear showdown between the two countries.</p>\n<p>The two countries have also been competing for influence in Central Asia, a region the Kremlin has long seen as its turf but is becoming increasingly important to China’s geopolitical and economic ambitions. China is building more railroads, highways and energy pipelines in former Soviet republics such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which still rely on Russia as a crucial security partner.</p>\n<h2><b>How close are Xi and Putin?</b></h2>\n<p>Right before the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022, Xi and Putin declared publicly that their countries’ relationship had “no limits.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Xi has often described Putin as his best friend. During an economic forum in Russia in 2018, the two fried Russian pancakes and took vodka shots together. For Xi’s 66th birthday in 2019, Putin presented him with a cake and a giant box of ice cream.</p>\n<p>In an article published in a Chinese newspaper Sunday, Putin said the two enjoyed the “warmest relationship,” noting that they have met about 40 times in recent years and always found time to talk at “no‑tie” events.</p>\n<h2><b>What is the economic relationship between Russia and China?</b></h2>\n<p>Economic ties between China and Russia have strengthened significantly since Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, when it annexed Crimea. At the time, China helped Russia evade the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration that were supposed to cut off Russia’s access to global markets.</p>\n<p>In the wake of harsher sanctions against Russia following the start of the Ukraine war last year, China has helped to supply many of the products that Russia previously purchased from Western-allied countries, including computer chips, smartphones and raw materials needed for military equipment.</p>\n<p>Total trade between Russia and China surged last year.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/turmoil-in-israel-8478880/\">Turmoil in Israel: Pushback in the streets as Netanyahu targets judiciary</a></div>\n<h2><b>What does Putin want from China?</b></h2>\n<p>Putin needs China to help bolster his economy, which has been battered by Western sanctions. For the Russian leader, China has increasingly become a lifeline for investment and trade.

Meanwhile, the Swiss government said it would provide more than $9 billion to backstop some losses that UBS may incur by taking over Credit Suisse, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/credit-suisse-ubs-bank-collapse-us-fed-8507215/\">Credit Suisse sold to UBS: Why are banks in turmoil across the world</a></div>\n<p>In a statement issued on Sunday (March 19), UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher said, “Acquiring Credit Suisse’s capabilities in wealth, asset management and Swiss universal banking will augment UBS’s strategy of growing its capital-light businesses. The transaction will bring benefits to clients and create long-term sustainable value for our investors.”</p>\n<h2><strong>History of UBS bank</strong></h2>\n<p>Known for providing private banking, wealth management, asset management, and investment banking services for private, corporate and institutional clients, UBS was established in 1998 when two of Switzerland’s biggest banks, the Swiss Bank Corporation and the Union Bank of Switzerland, were joined together. Notably, the name UBS, although it has been derived from “Union Bank of Switzerland”, isn’t an acronym.</p>\n<p>The Swiss Bank Corporation was originally set up as Basel Bank Corporation in 1854 by six private bankers in Basel in order to provide credit to Swiss railroad and manufacturing companies. In subsequent years, it merged with Zürich Bank Corporation and entered the commercial banking sector. By 1897, the Basel Bank Corporation had consumed two other Swiss banks and changed its name to Swiss Bank Corporation. It went on to acquire several more banks in the following years, opening its branches across Switzerland and other countries.</p>\n<p>The Union Bank of Switzerland opened up in 1912 after the Bank in Winterthur (1862) was merged with Toggenburger Bank (1863). Much like the Swiss Bank Corporation, the Union Bank of Switzerland also absorbed a host of banks in Switzerland and became one of the biggest banks in the country.</p>\n<p>Despite the success of both the Swiss Bank Corporation and the Union Bank of Switzerland, they were merged together as they faced intense competition from American banks. Thus, in 1998, UBS Group AG or UBS was born.</p><div>Also Read</div><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Today, it is one of the largest banks in the world with a market capitalization of $63 billion, as per a 2022 report. With its headquarter in Zurich, UBS has around 200 branches and 4,600 client advisors in Switzerland alone. It also provides its services in 50 other countries, including India.</p>\n</div> ",

The Bench declined to entertain Venkatramani’s argument that the contents of the note were “confidential” and “issues of sensitivity” were involved. The AG then read out the note in court.</p><p>“I am personally averse to sealed covers,” the CJI told the A-G, Livelaw reported. “What happens is, we see something, he does not see.

He had expressed similar views earlier too, as had former CJI N V Ramana.</p>\n<p><strong>What is “sealed cover jurisprudence”?</strong></p>\n<p>It is the practice of seeking and accepting information from government agencies in sealed envelopes that can only be perused by judges. It has been followed by the Supreme Court in the past, and sometimes lower courts as well.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p><strong>Under what circumstances does the court seek information in a sealed cover?</strong></p>\n<p>This can happen in broadly two kinds of cases: (i) when the information is connected to an ongoing investigation and, (ii) when the information is personal or confidential in nature.</p>\n<p>It is understood that in the first situation, an ongoing investigation could be impeded by the disclosure, and in the second situation, an individual’s privacy could be affected or there may be a breach of trust.</p>\n<p><strong>So what is the problem then?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The secrecy could end up preventing a party from having a full overview of the charges against them.

The disclosure of relevant material to the adjudicating authority in a sealed cover makes the process of adjudication vague and opaque”.</p>\n<p>This, the court said, “perpetuates two problems”:</p>\n<p>“Firstly, it denies the aggrieved party their legal right to effectively challenge an order since the adjudication of issues has proceeded on the basis of unshared material provided in a sealed cover…</p>\n<p>“Secondly, it perpetuates a culture of opaqueness and secrecy. It bestows absolute power in the hands of the adjudicating authority. It also tilts the balance of power in a litigation in favour of a dominant party which has control over information. Most often than not this is the state. A judicial order accompanied by reasons is the hallmark of the justice system… The sealed cover procedure affects the functioning of the justice delivery system both at an individual case- to case level and at an institutional level.”</p>\n<p><strong>But surely not all information can be circulated indiscriminately?</strong></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court in its judgment clarified that “this is not to say that all information must be disclosed in the public”.

The court has expressed this view even before this week, last month, and in October last year. Some examples:</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>* In March 2022, in a case involving the Bihar government, a three-judge Bench headed by then CJI Ramana insisted that all arguments should be made in open court. “Please don’t give us a sealed cover, we don’t want it here,” the then CJI had told counsel for Patna High Court.</p>\n<p>* Later that same day, Justice Chandrachud, during the hearing on an appeal against the Centre’s ban on the Malayalam TV channel MediaOne, said, “We are averse to sealed cover jurisprudence. Do you have issues if we go through the record now?”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The channel had gone off air on February 8 after the Kerala High Court upheld the ban by relying on documents submitted by the Centre in a sealed envelope. But the SC declined to allow the same practice, and subsequently stayed the ban.</p>\n<p>* In December 2019, while granting bail to former Minister P Chidambaram in the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/chidambaram-inx-media-scam-case-explained-karti-5921402/\">INX media case</a>, a Supreme Court Bench of Justices R Banumathi, A S Bopanna, and Hrishikesh Roy censured the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a> High Court for relying on material submitted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a sealed cover.</p>\n<p>“It would be against the concept of fair trial if in every case the prosecution presents documents in sealed cover and the findings on the same are recorded as if the offence is committed and the same is treated as having a bearing for denial or grant of bail,” the Bench said.</p>\n<p><strong>So how did the use of sealed covers become common?</strong></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has itself encouraged the practice of seeking public interest-related information in sealed envelopes, most recently under former CJI and now <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/\">Rajya Sabha</a> member Justice <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/ranjan-gogoi/\">Ranjan Gogoi</a>.</p>\n<p>* In the Rafale aircraft case, the court accepted the government’s argument that the matter pertained to the Official Secrets Act.</p>\n<p>* While refusing to stay the arrest of activists held in the Bhima-<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-was-the-battle-of-koregaon-mahar-dalit-marathas-maharashtra-bandh-5009488/\">Koregaon</a> case, it relied on “evidence” submitted by the Maharashtra police in a sealed envelope.</p>\n<p>* In the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/\">NRC</a> exercise in Assam — which led to about 19 lakh citizens being excluded from the list — the apex court sought details from the NRC coordinator in a sealed cover with neither the government nor the affected parties being allowed to look at them.</p>\n<p>* In the case involving corruption allegations against former CBI director Alok Verma, the court insisted that the Central Vigilance Commission submit its report in a sealed cover, ostensibly to maintain public confidence in the agency.</p>\n<p>* In the 2G case, in which it had cancelled a large number of licences, the court had relied on sealed covers.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>* During the hearing in the Chidambaram case, while trying to persuade the court to refer to information in the sealed cover, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had referred to a case from 1997, involving P V Prabhakar Rao, the son of former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao.</p>\n</div> ",

Over the years, the judiciary and the legislature have examined the question of whether the SC status can extend to Muslim and Christian Dalits.</p><h2>What is the Centre’s stand?</h2>\n<p>In November 2022, when the Apex Court considered this issue in ‘Centre for Public Interest Litigation and Another vs Union of India’, the Central government submitted that the Constitution (Scheduled Caste) Order, 1950 challenged in the present case was based on historical data which established that “no backwardness or oppression was ever faced by members of Christian or Islamic Society.”</p>\n<p>The affidavit filed by the Centre added that the reason why Dalits convert to Islam or Christianity is to come out of the oppressive system of untouchability in Hinduism, which is not prevalent in either of the two religions.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/no-reservation-needed-for-dalit-christians-muslims-sangh-wing-8482876/\">No reservation needed for Dalit Christians, Muslims: Sangh wing</a></div>\n<p>The Centre also quoted a dissenting note from the National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities report stating that Islam and Christianity are foreign religions that do not recognise the caste system. Conferring SC status on converts will amount to introducing the caste system in those religions, the report said.</p>\n<p>Before this, on October 7, 2022, the Centre had established a three-member commission, headed by former CJI KG Balakrishnan, to examine the grant of SC status to persons who claimed to historically belong to the scheduled castes but had subsequently converted to religions other than the ones mentioned in the Presidential Orders issued under Article 341 of the Constitution. The Commission is scheduled to submit its report in 2024, while the question of reservations for Muslim &amp; Christian Dalits remains unanswered before the Apex Court.</p>\n<h2>What is the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950?</h2>\n<p>In 1950, when the Constitution was being framed, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, was issued under Article 341 of the Constitution which says that the President may for any State or UT publicly notify and specify the “castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes, which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Caste.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/reservations-dalit-christians-muslims-8160523/\">On reservations for Dalit Christians and Muslims, a question of government’s intent</a></div>\n<p>The original order was passed in 1950 and allowed only Hindus to be classified as SCs. However, it was later amended to include Sikhs in 1956, and Buddhists in 1990, in the wake of political pressure. Despite these amendments, no provisions were made to include backward communities within Christians and Muslims under the definition of SCs.</p>\n<h2>The two reports under the UPA Government</h2>\n<p>In October 2004, the UPA government headed by Dr <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/manmohan-singh/\">Manmohan Singh</a> established the National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities, headed by erstwhile CJI Justice Ranganath Misra, to recommend measures for the welfare of socially and economically backward sections among religious and linguistic minorities.</p>\n<p>Three years later, in May 2007, the Ranganath Misra Commission submitted its report, recommending a complete delinking of religion from the classification of Scheduled Castes. The Commission also recommended that reservations be made religion-neutral and that socio-economic criteria should be the basis for such a classification. However, Parliament rejected these recommendations on account of inadequate field data.</p><div>Also Read</div><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>To resolve this ambiguity, the UPA government constituted the Sachar Committee in 2005 to examine the social and economic conditions of Indian Muslims. In 2006, the Committee came out with its report that observed the situation of Dalit Muslims to not improve even after conversion. The report placed Muslims below SCs and STs in backwardness. Among the many issues highlighted was the mismatch between the percentage of Muslims in the population and in decision-making positions such as the IAS and IPS.</p>\n</div> ",

Despite this, hiring prospects in India have continued to improve over the past year, with 64% of employers in the service and manufacturing industries expressing a positive outlook on hiring.

As a result, telecom companies plan to invest Rs 2,000 crore in the construction of large hyper-scale data centres, resulting in steady growth and job creation for blue-collar, gig, and grey-collar workers. Additionally, the information technology industry is also looking to establish data centres,” Mayur Taday, Chief Business Officer, TeamLease Services said.</p>\n<p>The report also stated that the hiring intent in Metro and Tier-1 cities in the services and manufacturing sectors is 91 per cent and 85 per cent, respectively.</p><div>Also Read</div><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In rural areas, the hiring intention is the lowest across all geographies and sectors in Q1 FY24.

The traffic growth at 5-7 per cent will also remain healthy, albeit on a low base of fiscal 2022. This resilience in traffic growth will be on the back of economic activity-led commercial traffic, and strong personal mobility, supported by leisure and business travel,” Anand Kulkarni, Director, CRISIL Ratings, said.</p>\n<p>In fiscal year 2024, traffic growth is expected to taper to 4-6 per cent, but will remain higher than the four-year compound annual growth rate of 2-3 per cent seen through fiscal 2022.</p>\n<p>Further, with WPI inflation printing lower at 4.95 per cent for December 2022, the next fiscal will see a toll rate hike of 5 per cent. Consequently, toll revenue is expected to grow 9-11 per cent for fiscal 2024, the report said.</p>\n<p>The toll road sector has faced multiple headwinds since fiscal 2018, such as the impact of goods and services tax (GST) implementation, change in axle load norms for commercial vehicles, restrictions due to the pandemic, and supply chain disruptions, affecting the movement of traffic. These factors combined, limited traffic growth to 2-3% between fiscals 2018 and 2022.</p>\n<p>However, the toll roads are preferred by investors looking to pool road assets together under infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) to generate healthy returns and benefit from inflation hedging. As a result, the toll roads account for 70 per cent assets held under road sector InvITs.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“The credit profiles of toll road players have remained strong in fiscal 2023 and will sustain in fiscal 2024, helped by healthy toll revenue growth,” said Saina Kathawala, Associate Director, CRISIL Ratings.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>Any unforeseen weakening of the economic environment and its impact on commercial traffic performance will bear watching over the medium term, the report stated.</p>\n</div> ",

          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"4.894736842105263\" morss_score=\"22.153357531760435\">\n<p>In the Union Budget for 2023-24, the government expanded the scope of full rebate on income tax under the new tax regime to an annual taxable income of Rs 7 lakh from Rs 5 lakh earlier. However, those earning even marginally higher than the threshold were required to pay tax on sub-Rs 7 lakh slabs as well. To provide relief to such taxpayers, the government has amended the Finance Bill, limiting the tax outgo to the incremental taxable income over Rs 7 lakh per year.</p><p>For instance, as per the original proposal presented as part of the Budget, if a taxpayer had a taxable income of Rs 7 lakh per annum, she was not required to pay any income tax due to the full rebate. But if she had an annual taxable income of Rs 7,00,100 per year, she was liable to pay Rs 25,010 as income tax as she was not eligible for the full rebate. This meant that despite earning just Rs 100 over the rebate limit, the taxpayer was saddled with over Rs 25,000 as tax liability. With the amendment now, her total tax liability would be Rs 100–the income that exceeded the threshold of Rs 7 lakh.</p>\n<p>The government is going all out to convince individual taxpayers to migrate to the new income tax regime by overhauling slabs and offering additional sops to the lowest as well as the topmost strata of taxpayers.</p>\n<p>After announcing the changes to the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/budget-2023-what-is-the-new-tax-regime-and-will-you-get-i-t-rebate-8417446/\">new tax regime</a> in her budget speech, Sitharaman had told reporters that the government’s effort was to make the new tax regime, which does not have any exemptions, lucrative enough for taxpayers. Though the new regime was introduced in 2020, migration to it from the old and deduction-heavy tax system was extremely underwhelming so far. The government expects that the tide will now turn as the new regime will lead to savings for most taxpayers, except those claiming heavy tax exemptions.</p>\n<p>While no changes were made in the old tax regime in the Budget, the government increased the scope of rebate to those with a taxable income of Rs 7 lakh per year from the earlier limit of Rs 5 lakh in the new system. The super-rich–those with annual income of over Rs 5 crore–will also benefit from a significant cut income tax surcharge to 25 per cent from 37 per cent under the new regime. This would reduce the effective rate of income tax for this group to 39 per cent from 42.7 per cent. The tax burden under the new scheme was also rationalised by revising its slabs and introducing the benefit of standard deduction. At the time, the revenue foregone due to changes in the new tax regime was pegged at around Rs 35,000 crore.</p>\n</div> ",

Any change in government’s market borrowing now to accommodate upfront payment of arrears would have impacted market yields, which are also seen as crucial for states’ borrowings.</p>\n<p>“Borrowing management is essential. The borrowing calendar is disclosed every year in advance. Sudden changes to the borrowing calendar after the market borrowing has been completed has severe yield-related implications,” the official said.</p>\n<p>While the apex court had come down heavily on the government for submitting its reply on the issue in a sealed cover, its agreement to a phased implementation provides a fiscal breather for the government to first clear other dues, such as the Rs 36,325 crore apportioned for fertiliser subsidies in the supplementary demands for grants.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/controversy-orop-dues-govt-defence-8509435/\">The controversy on the govt’s move to clear OROP arrears in four batches</a></div>\n<p>The government’s fiscal calculations have been under strain in the aftermath of the Russia-<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/russia-invasion-ukraine-history-creation-explained-7791147/\">Ukraine</a> war and a global economic slowdown.

The allocation for pension and social security under the Finance Ministry stands at Rs 71,701 crore for FY24. The pension expenditure of the Defence Ministry has been more than 20 per cent of the ministry’s budget over the last five years, with pension payments growing at an annual rate of 12 per cent between 2013-14 and 2023-24. The pensions under OROP get revised every few years, unlike other pension or government payout revisions, which get revised only during the Pay Commission, thus becoming a significant financial cost to the government, a person aware of the matter said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/sc-raps-ministry-defence-arrears-orop-installments-8469503/\">SC raps Ministry of Defence over payment of arrears of OROP in installments</a></div>\n<p>In December 2022, the government approved revision of OROP pension with effect from July 1, 2019. More than 25.13 lakh (including over 4.52 lakh new beneficiaries) Armed Forces pensioners/family pensioners were estimated to benefit from this revision.</p>\n<p>At that time, the government had said that arrears would be paid in four half-yearly instalments, except for family pensioners — including those in receipt of special/liberalised family pension and Gallantry Award Winners — who would be paid arrears in one instalment. The arrears from July 2019 are estimated to be Rs 28,138 crore, for which a provision of the same amount has been made in the Defence Ministry’s revised estimates for 2022-23.

          "description": "",
          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"4.849673202614379\" morss_score=\"22.10829389226955\">\n<p>In the Union Budget for 2023-24, the government expanded the scope of full rebate on income tax under the new tax regime to an annual taxable income of Rs 7 lakh from Rs 5 lakh earlier. However, those earning even marginally higher than the threshold were required to pay tax on sub-Rs 7 lakh slabs as well. To provide relief to such taxpayers, the government has amended the Finance Bill, limiting the tax outgo to the incremental taxable income over Rs 7 lakh per year.</p><p>For instance, as per the original proposal presented as part of the Budget, if a taxpayer had a taxable income of Rs 7 lakh per annum, she was not required to pay any income tax due to the full rebate. But if she had an annual taxable income of Rs 7,00,100 per year, she was liable to pay Rs 25,010 as income tax as she was not eligible for the full rebate. This meant that despite earning just Rs 100 over the rebate limit, the taxpayer was saddled with over Rs 25,000 as tax liability. With the amendment now, her total tax liability would be Rs 100–the income that exceeded the threshold of Rs 7 lakh.</p>\n<p>The government is going all out to convince individual taxpayers to migrate to the new income tax regime by overhauling slabs and offering additional sops to the lowest as well as the topmost strata of taxpayers.</p>\n<p>After announcing the changes to the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/budget-2023-what-is-the-new-tax-regime-and-will-you-get-i-t-rebate-8417446/\">new tax regime</a> in her budget speech, Sitharaman had told reporters that the government’s effort was to make the new tax regime, which does not have any exemptions, lucrative enough for taxpayers. Though the new regime was introduced in 2020, migration to it from the old and deduction-heavy tax system was extremely underwhelming so far. The government expects that the tide will now turn as the new regime will lead to savings for most taxpayers, except those claiming heavy tax exemptions.</p>\n<p>While no changes were made in the old tax regime in the Budget, the government increased the scope of rebate to those with a taxable income of Rs 7 lakh per year from the earlier limit of Rs 5 lakh in the new system. The super-rich–those with annual income of over Rs 5 crore–will also benefit from a significant cut income tax surcharge to 25 per cent from 37 per cent under the new regime. This would reduce the effective rate of income tax for this group to 39 per cent from 42.7 per cent. The tax burden under the new scheme was also rationalised by revising its slabs and introducing the benefit of standard deduction. At the time, the revenue foregone due to changes in the new tax regime was pegged at around Rs 35,000 crore.</p>\n</div> ",

The amount spent on foreign travels during the first 10 months of the current fiscal more than doubled when compared to the same period of previous fiscal as flights resumed and travel restrictions were eased by countries in the wake of subsiding Covid pandemic.</p><p>Under the LRS, Indian residents can remit up to $ 250,000 every financial year.</p>\n<p>However, the scenario is likely to change from July 1, 2023 when the higher tax on LRS on foreign travel comes into force. In a bid to trace high-value spending and tax avoidance by high net-worth individuals, the Union Budget this year announced a sharp hike in the tax collected at source (TCS) rate — to 20 per cent from 5 per cent — on overseas tour packages and on certain remittances out of India under the LRS. This has been proposed with the exception of LRS remittances for education and medical treatment purposes.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is a 5 per cent tax on funds in excess of Rs 7 lakh sent out of India under the LRS of the RBI. The government apparently hiked the tax on remittances as people were making high-value remittances but their tax returns were not reflecting proportionate income tax payments. Had the government imposed the tax with effect from April 2022, it would have collected Rs 18,800 crore tax from overseas travel remittances of people.</p>\n<p>Moreover, foreign exchange reserves of the country have not made much increase in the last a few months in the wake of the rising interest rates abroad and capital outflows from the stock market. Reserves fell by $ 2.39 billion to a three-month low of $ 560.003 billion for the week ended March 10, the RBI said in its latest weekly data release.</p>\n<p>During January, the amount spent by Indians for traveling to foreign destinations stood at $1.49 billion – the highest in the current financial year. In fiscal 2021-22, the total spending by Indians on overseas travel stood at $6.9 billion.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The data showed that travel constitutes more than 50 per cent of the total outward remittances allowed under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) for resident individuals in April-January of FY2023. During 2021-22, the share of travel was 35 per cent of the overall international spending by Indians.</p>\n<p>The outward remittances under the LRS scheme stood at $22.08 billion in the first 10 months of this fiscal.</p>\n<p>Besides travel, Indians spend money overseas on gifts, donations, maintenance of close relatives, education, medical treatment, purchase of immovable property, investment in equity or debt and deposits. In April-January, $2.3 billion was spent on gifts, same as in FY22.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Indians spent around $3 billion on education in the first ten months compared to $5.16 billion in FY22. Money spent on maintenance of close relatives was $3.22 billion. In FY22, the money spent under the same category stood at $3.3 billion, the RBI data showed.</p>\n</div> </div>\n",

India’s private non-financial sector debt has witnessed a steady decline since mid-2021, along with an improvement in the quality of debt. India’s corporate sector credit-GDP ratio is also below its historical trend, implying sufficient space for the corporate sector to borrow further. The strong debt profile portrayed by corporates will prove to be critical in maintaining the macroeconomic stability of the economy going forward,” it said.</p>\n<div><span>Also read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/audio/3-things/credit-suisse-gets-sold-foreign-lawyers-in-india-and-stalling-parliament/8508959/\">Credit Suisse gets sold, foreign lawyers in India, and stalling Parliament</a></div>\n<p>The tightening of monetary policy tends to create new vulnerabilities in economies where debt levels are low and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities where debt is already high, precipitating significant disruptions to the functioning of the financial system, it said. Citing data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the ministry said the core debt of the corporate sector increased in both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs), reaching 175 per cent of GDP in EMEs and 185 per cent of GDP in AEs at the end of 2020, adding that India is amongst a small set of countries that have been able to reduce their debt burden from Q3 2008 to Q3 2022. “This is a result of the banking sector’s balance sheet clean-up and the corporate sector’s deleveraging exercise undertaken over the last decade. India’s relatively lower debt burdens will help limit the impact of financial contagion that may arise as rising borrowing costs trigger debt sustainability concerns,” it said.</p>\n<p>In India, despite the Swiss regulators’ intervention to protect the global financial system, investor sentiment remained shaky with the benchmark Sensex falling over 900 points at one stage before closing 0.62 per cent, or 361 points, down at 57,628.95 and the NSE Nifty Index falling 112 points at 16,988.40 on Monday.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/credit-suisse-shares-slump-over-61-in-premarket-trading-after-ubs-deal-8507693/\">Bank shares plummet as Credit Suisse rescue fails to quell contagion fears</a></div>\n<p>The fear of contagion continued to roil the global financial sector and stock markets on Monday even after Swiss bank UBS agreed to buy its banking rival Credit Suisse in a $3.25 billion takeover over the weekend. The pessimist mood prevailing across the global markets triggered a major sell-off in global markets, including India, as investors are still battling a slew of negative news from turmoil in large global banks to macro-economic concerns and falling commodity prices.</p>\n<p>The Indian stock markets have now plummeted 9.36 per cent with the Sensex plunging from the 52-week high of 63,583.07 recorded on December 1, 2022</p>\n<p>Global markets, including India, are now awaiting the outcome of the US <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-fed-and-what-role-does-it-play-us-economy-7824639/\">Federal Reserve</a> meeting to see how they will respond to the ongoing crisis, particularly in terms of rate hikes.

What has unnerved investors and depositors is the parlous banking situation with many US banks potentially at risk of a run.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Amid the ongoing US banking crisis, the Indian banking system continues to remain resilient and stable, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week. “We have been engaging with the banks over the last several years and I am happy to report that the way the Indian banking system has evolved and the way it is positioned today, the Indian banking system continues to be resilient and stable,” Das said</p>\n<p>He, however, cautioned lenders against build-up of any asset-liability mismanagement and asked them to keep conducting internal stress tests to ensure proper risk assessment.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The proposed takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS – both Swiss banks – is expected to witness consolidation of the Indian operations of both the banks. While UBS and Credit Suisse are present in India in the investment banking and wealth management areas, the latter has a banking licence with just one branch operating in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/\">Mumbai</a>.</p>\n<p>UBS Securities India Pvt Ltd is a Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) registered stock broker and holds membership on the NSE and the BSE. UBS provides corporate, institutional and wealth management clients with expert advice, innovative solutions, execution and comprehensive access to international capital markets in India. India is one of the technology hubs of UBS with a sizeable workforce.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, incorporated in December 1996, is involved in activities auxiliary to financial intermediation, except insurance and pension funding. It already offers wealth management, investment banking and asset management in India, serving high net worth, corporate and institutional clients.</p>\n<p>These two firms are likely to be integrated as the global merger process takes shape in the coming months. Neelkanth Mishra, Co-head of Asia-Pacific strategy of Credit Suisse Securities, recently decided to step down from his role and move to head the research wing at Axis Bank.</p>\n<p>As many as 45 foreign banks are present in India, but they have a relatively smaller presence in India with 6 per cent share in total assets, 4 per cent in loans and 5 per cent in deposits. They are more active in the derivative markets (forex and interest rates) where they have 50 per cent share. Most of them are present as branches of the parent bank with only a few present as a wholly-owned subsidiary.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>Nevertheless, they retain capital, liquidity and make similar annual report disclosures as Indian banks, it said. Top five foreign banks in India by assets are HSBC, Citibank (it has now sold its consumer business to Axis), Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan Chase which is also the largest US bank.</p>\n</div> ",

Both are two major direct instruments of the RBI’s monetary policy as well. They are designed to meet different purposes. The CRR is aimed to control the credit creating capacity of the banks by instructing them to keep certain proportion of the deposits as reserves with the RBI. This means that that reserves cannot be given as loan and that much money is not circulated in the economy. The SLR on the other hand, requires banks to deploy a certain proportion of their deposits in liquid assets like government securities. The objective of SLR is to ensure that all the funds are not loaned out to the public. If the banks are deploying a certain proportion of their deposits in liquid assets, it may help them to convert into cash in emergency time.</p>\n<p><strong>What is CRR?</strong></p>\n<p>The cash reserve ratio is the proportion of demand and time deposits (Net Demand and Time Liabilities) that every scheduled commercial bank has to keep with the RBI as cash reserves.</p>\n<p><strong>What is SLR? </strong></p>\n<p>Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) is a requirement that commercial banks have to keep a certain proportion of their demand and time deposits as liquid assets in their vault.  In the context of SLR, liquid assets mean assets in the form of cash, gold and approved securities (government securities).</p>\n<p>Both are ratios that are expressed as a percentage of the bank’s deposits. The CRR and SLR are to be kept by the scheduled banks in India as well as local area banks which are non-scheduled banks. A Crucial difference is that while CRR is to be kept with the RBI, the SLR is to be kept with the concerned banks’ vault. The difference between the CRR and the SLR are given below.</p>\n<p>Table: Difference between CRR and SLR</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>CRR</strong></td>\n<td><strong>SLR</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>What is?</td>\n<td>The percentage of total deposits (Net Demand and Time Liabilities or NDTL) that banks are required to hold as cash reserves with the RBI.\n<p>CRR should be kept on a daily basis.</p></td>\n<td>The percentage of total deposits (demand and time deposits) that banks are required to hold in the form of liquid assets such as government securities.

The CRR is a percentage of total deposits that banks must hold as cash with the central bank, while the SLR is a percentage of total deposits that banks must hold as liquid assets such as government securities. The CRR is used to control the money supply in the economy and regulate inflation, while the SLR is used to ensure liquidity of banks. The liquid assets under SLR may give the bank an opportunity to covert the liquid assets into cash through the emergency liquidity window called Marginal Standing Facility.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.indianeconomy.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CRR-vs-SLR.png\"></p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n",

The seller doesn’t own the shares he is selling, rather, these shares are automatically borrowed from another owner. The logic of short selling is that the seller expects the value of this share to decline in near future ( in the same day) and he buys the share later to complete the transaction. Short selling is an intra-day transaction mostly.</p>\n<p>Understand that the seller doesn’t owned the share and hence he has to return the share by buying later from the market and thus automatically returning. Under short selling, the investor actually is assumed to be borrowing the shares from the market.</p>\n<p><strong>How can a trader sell a share without buying it?</strong></p>\n<p>The doubt for any individual is how a trader can sell shares when he has not bought them. Here, understand that such a facility is allowed in the stock market by the regulators. Individuals and institutions can sell the share they are not owned but there is an important condition that he should buy the shares later in the day to complete the transaction.</p>\n<p>The borrowing and later returning part are not directly involved by the trader. He has to just sell first and buy later to fulfil his deal (need not bother about borrowing and later returning scenarios and this will be automatically done through the market mechanism). Retail investors and institutional investors like Hindenburg can also make short selling.</p>\n<p>This facility of short selling is allowed by the regulators to impart more volume and liquidity in the market or to enhance stock market activity. Usually short selling happens in a bearish markets when there is scope for heavy drop in the share price in immediate future.</p>\n<p>The normal trading pattern in the market is we are buying a particular share, expecting that its price will go up in the future. Then we will be selling the shares we bought and will be making good profit. This is the normal investment pattern. The opposite is short selling. Short selling is an unorthodox type of speculative deal in the sense that we are mainly used to buying first and selling later.</p>\n<p>Following explains short selling process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The trader expects a fall in the share of a company.</li>\n<li>He sells (doesn’t bought the share so far – this is very important and it is assumed that he is borrowing the share from the market to sell) the shares for Rs 50.</li>\n<li>Later the shares’ price falls to Rs 30 and then he buys the share to complete the transaction.</li>\n<li>Here, the trader’s profit is Rs 20.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The mindset of the short seller is that he expects that the price of the share he is selling is going to fall soon. Here, regulators allow traders to sell first (short selling) and buy later to complete the transaction. Speculation is the main motive behind short selling. Several investors also short-sell for hedging ( to insure an opposite transaction of buying (or long position) the shares) purposes. Remember in the stock market terminology, a long position indicates buying transaction whereas a short position denotes a selling transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens when the investor doesn’t buy (to complete the transaction) later?</strong></p>\n<p morss_own_score=\"7.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Here, automatically, the transaction will be automatically <em>squared off </em>at a particular time (in the NSE, it is 3.20 pm) towards the end of the trading day and the automatic buying price will be the price prevailing at that time (3,.20 pm in the NSE).</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages and disadvantages of short selling</strong></p>\n<p>The advantages and disadvantages of short selling is like the two sides of a coin. You can make big profit through short selling. At the same time, the disadvantage is that you can make big losses as well.</p>\n<p>****<img src=\"https://www.indianeconomy.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Short-selling.png\">*****</p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n",

          "content": "<div class=\"td-ss-main-content\" morss_own_score=\"5.686103542234332\" morss_score=\"10.558488479472825\">\n<div class=\"td-post-content\" morss_own_score=\"6.0\" morss_score=\"92.5\">\n\n\n<p>The Rupee’s depreciation against the US Dollar is continuing in the background of a group of adverse factors.</p>\n<p>The ongoing depreciation is <span>not a rupee specific symptom</span>. Rather, most of the emerging market currencies are registering steep depreciation in the context of the strengthening of the US Dollar and other adverse global factors. Compared to several EM peers, the rupee fared well. Still, the rupee’s achievement of avoiding the rapid depreciation came at the cost of continuous decline in the RBI’s foreign exchange reserves.</p>\n<p><em>Now get into the background: the rupee scenario is featured by two factors</em></p>\n<p morss_own_score=\"6.0\" morss_score=\"8.0\"><strong>Factor 1:</strong> As on mid-October 2022, the rupee depreciated by almost 9% in this calendar year so far. Several other currencies undergone even further dip in their values.</p>\n<p><strong>Factor 2:</strong> The RBI’s foreign exchange reserves fell by nearly $ 109 billion in the span of one year.</p>\n<p>The foreign exchange reserves of the RBI was $642.45 billion on September 3<sup>rd</sup> last year and it came down to $532.66 billion for the week ending Sep 30. The RBI Governor told that nearly 67% of the decline in foreign exchange reserves is due to valuation changes in forex reserves (meaning not just due to selling of dollars in the forex market).</p>\n<p>Combining these two-point shows that the Rupee was not a worse performer mainly because the RBI’s intervention in the foreign exchange market through selling of sizable $109 billion made its effect.</p>\n<p>Now, forecasting the rupee’s forward path needs identification of the underlying global and national factors that may influence the rupee’s path in the coming months.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the prevailing adverse factors that are going to bring downward pressure on rupee?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The persisting global inflation-tendency of the central banks to raise their interest rates and the consequent capital outflow from India (capital flight). Central banks and their upward interest rate policy to match the high inflationary situation produces capital outflows.</li>\n<li>The widening trade deficit and the current account deficit.</li>\n<li>Crude prices may go up soon as OPEC plus decided to cut output.</li>\n<li>Increasing difficulty of the RBI to use the limited forex reserves if the rupee slides further.</li>\n<li>Continuing Ukraine war and the geopolitical risks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What are the favourable factors that may support the rupee?</p>\n<p>Of course, there are not much. Still, the emergence of a number of positive domestic macroeconomic factors like a relatively higher growth rate, higher tax revenues, increasing credit growth etc, may make our economy a better choice for foreign investors. This development is crucial in the context of spreading recession in several parts of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>The RBI’s ability and willingness to sell Dollar in the foreign exchange market is limited. </strong></p>\n<p>Now an important question is the ability of the RBI to support the Rupee. Two factors have to be considered here.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> The size of foreign exchange reserves compared to our payment requirements </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>First is the size of the foreign exchange reserve vis a vis the size of the foreign exchange outflows and payment obligations. Remember that the forex reserve is its lowest in two years sitting at $532 billion as on end September 2022. More than this, the RBI has already lost forex reserves worth of $109 billion in recent quarters. Understandably, there is no momentum and willingness to spent more.</p>\n<p><strong>Whether the RBI will be ready to sell more dollars should be checked based on few crucial logics. </strong></p>\n<p>First is that foreign exchange reserves are always a token of confidence against unwarranted depreciation. Speculators and dealers can anticipate any intervention only if the RBI has sizable reserves. Hence, a minimum volume of reserves should be there as a matter of confidence and trust. Depleting this threshold level is suicidal as it may encourage people to choose dollar more so as to avoid steep depreciation risks. The mark of $536 billion is necessary to maintain the confidence or prospects of potential intervention. A true reserve should be sizable.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the size of the present reserves is not big compared to the country’s foreign exchange payment obligations.</p>\n<p>The import bill is nearly $490 billion, external debt is $620 billion and there is the potential trade deficit size is $190 billion. Adding to these, the outflow of portfolio capital more frequently with the uncertainty in the global financial market makes the RBI’s intervention practically ineffective. When the market is on downward trend, the rupee will come under pressure and hence, the RBI will have to spend dollars every time. This is not practical. Hence, it is better for the RBI not to sell dollars in the forex market.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> The second factor is that the RBI’s policy is not aimed at targeting rupee’s exchange rate. </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>No modern-day central bank is ready to target exchange rate of the currency. Central banks would like to concentrate on their core function of price stability by targeting inflation. They are known for fighting inflation. The RBI belongs to the same class.</p>\n<p><strong>Now what will happen when the RBI targets exchange rate?</strong></p>\n<p>Imagine that there is depreciation of rupee.</p>\n<p>To counter the depreciation, the RBI has to sell dollar (intervention) in the forex market. This is done by selling Dollar and buying equivalent value of rupee. Such a step will reduce the availability of rupee in the market, or we can say that liquidity (rupee liquidity) in the market will come down. If there is already a low liquidity situation, the forex market intervention of selling dollar has done harm to the RBI’s liquidity objective.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the Rupee is appreciating, the RBI has to purchase Dollar by giving rupee. Sizable Dollar purchase will increase the supply of money (rupee) in the economy and hence, inflation may be aggravated. We cannot check appreciation and inflation simultaneously (monetary policy dilemma). Hence, in its rule book, the RBI never says that it is targeting the value of rupee. Though the major function of the RBI is to manage foreign exchange reserves, managing the value of rupee is not its declared objective (of course, implicitly, the RBI supports the rupee under managed flexibility exchange rate system that we have).</p>\n<p morss_own_score=\"7.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">This is why in the latest monetary policy declaration, RBI Governor said that “Let me set out the overall position once again. First, the rupee is a freely floating currency, and its exchange rate is market determined. Second, the <strong>RBI does not have any fixed exchange rate in mind</strong>. It intervenes in the market to curb excessive volatility and anchor expectations.”</p>\n<p>Given these factors, the rupee’s forward path is quite certain. It may fluctuate with underlying global and domestic factors. The RBI of course may make limited interventions and repeatedly may give indications about actions for supporting the Rupee. Both the government and the central bank should intimate the market constantly that they will support the rupee. This is quite customary and giving such messages themselves is helpful to an extent to counter excessive depreciation and higher speculation.</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.indianeconomy.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rupee-and-the-Reserves.png\"></p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n",

The southwest monsoon of 2021 was statistically normal, rescued from a deficit state to a near normal one by excess rainfall in September.  </p>\n<p>August 2021 was the sixth-driest month since 1901. While some farmers had normal crops, others lost them. But they were hopeful as the late withdrawal of monsoon and heavy rain in September and October meant good soil moisture and reservoir levels for a bumper harvest during the Rabi season.</p>\n<p>In the beginning of 2022, extreme rainfall and coldwaves dashed that hope by damaging standing crops. While the world was entering into a severe food crisis as the Russia-Ukraine war started, Indian farmers had their own battles to fight.</p>\n<p>The late withdrawal and excess rain events spurred the Rabi acreage. But the severe heatwave during harvest time in April-May 2022 led to widespread crop loss, particularly of wheat. This led to a downward revision of overall grain production.</p>\n<p>The wait for the monsoon started and the dire situation of 2021 repeated. Another “normal” monsoon with an uneven temporal and spatial distribution — long dry spells and heavy rains towards the end of the season, or in September — led to widespread crop loss.</p>\n<p>Excess rain in September has been an unmissable trend, at least in the last three years. The monsoon extended to the end of October, 2022; 52 per cent of the 36 meteorological subdivisions received above normal rainfall.</p>\n<p>This brought down the paddy harvest and delayed the Rabi crop for nearly two months. The sudden rise in temperature led to the stunting of the wheat crop and the government stopped export of wheat in May, anticipating a shortfall.</p>\n<p>So, for three consecutive crop seasons, there has been no occasion a farmer could even recover cost; accruing loss instead.</p>\n<p>Expectedly, all hopes were mortgaged to the Rabi crop of 2023. Farmers took up Rabi crops in 15 per cent more farms than last year. This year, the blow is severe — the winter has effectively vanished by January end and the country is experiencing mid-March temperatures.</p>\n<p>And this unusual high temperature is not just felt in the wheat-growing northern parts of India but also in the eastern part of the country. This will severely stunt the wheat crop, as in last year but on a wider scale. So, the losses are going to be more. This means for two years, a farmer has not experienced a normal crop season; has not earned anything effectively; but has to continue doing so.</p>\n<p>Will the next Kharif crop season be normal? Weather forecast has pressed the alarm bell — the three-year La Nina is on the wane and the dreaded El Nino will make an entry in 2023 by July. El Nino usually means a subdued monsoon for India and also extreme heat.</p>\n<p>It means, after losing a Rabi crop, farmers can’t even trade with hope for the Kharif now. As they say, hope is not a strategy or plan. But what if it is the only commodity that farmers own?</p>\n<p>For the country’s overall foodgrain situation is also going to be hit, adding food inflation as well as making the poor more vulnerable to food insecurity. The hope of the Rabi crop harvest reaching even last year’s level is waning.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the government’s food stock has been depleting, first for meeting the food security scheme’s commitment and second due to releasing some three million tonnes of grain into the market to keep the inflation under control.</p>\n<p>Without a bumper harvest in the next two months means we are hitting a scarcity situation. This will lead to higher food inflation. Notwithstanding the free foodgrains under the food security scheme, people have to fork out more for food. This adversely impacts the overall income levels, particularly for farmers who have not earned a profit for the last four consecutive seasons. </p>\n<p>Read more:</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

The first provides individual farmer-centric support (direct income support, subsidies, risk cover). The second category delivers public goods that enhance the overall capacity through sector-wide improvements in infrastructure and agricultural practices (research and extension, quality inputs, mechanisation, post-harvest management, institutional support).</span></p>\n<p><span>The Union Budget outlays on agriculture have signalled a high priority to individual farmer-centric support. This has, primarily, been in the form of two schemes: Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN) and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). </span></p>\n<p><span>These two schemes, along with Interest Subvention on Short Term Credit scheme, which provides direct monetary transfers to farmers, constitute around 73 per cent of the total allocations for agriculture and allied sectors in Union Budget 2023-24. </span></p>\n<p><span>On the other hand, sector-wide support measures, through schemes such as Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana</span> <span>(RKVY), Krishionnati Yojana, among others, collectively account for around 27 per cent.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Composition of Centre’s budgetary expenditure on agriculture &amp; allied sectors (%)</strong></p>\n<p><em><img title=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2023-02-22/0.56043500_1677050101_agri-budget.png\"></em></p>\n<p><em><span>Note:</span><span> “Individual farmer-centric direct support measures” include PM-KISAN, Interest Subvention Scheme and PMFBY</span><span>. </span><span>“Sector-wide support measures” include all other schematic and institutional expenditure on AAS. </span></em><em><span>Source: Walking the Tightrope: Analysis of Union Budget 2023-24, Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), New Delhi</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The increase in the budget envelope for agriculture and allied sectors in recent years has accorded higher priority to “individual farmer-centric direct support measures”. </span></p>\n<p><span>This pattern of budgetary provisioning is also reflected in some of the state budgets. In </span><a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/1042916/states-are-replicating-the-centres-farmer-centric-agriculture-budget-and-that-is-not-good\"><span>some states</span></a><span> such as Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, the total budgetary allocation for individual farmer-centric direct support measures surpasses the total budgetary allocation for sector-wide support measures.</span></p>\n<p><span>There is obviously an urgent need to provide direct financial support to farmers to subsidise their growing input costs and attend to the growing risks of climate vulnerability. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, it will be a concern if both Union and state governments start according higher budgetary priority only to direct support measures. Priority to sector-wide support measures is equally essential to pursue long-term and sustained improvements in agriculture and ensure the viability of farming as an occupation.</span></p>\n<p><span>One of the factors that may be favouring the prioritisation of individual farmer-centric measures over the sector-wide support measures is the better utilisation of allocated funds under the former than the latter. Many states, particularly the poorer ones, could not contribute their share of matching grants under centrally sponsored schemes (CSS), which resulted in underutilisation of funds released from the Centre. </span></p>\n<p><span>Most of the CSSs, such as RKVY, demand a grant of 40 per cent from states (as against 100 per cent contribution by the Union government before 2015-16). This is due to the implementation of recommendations by the panel on the rationalisation of centrally sponsored schemes </span><a href=\"https://www.cbgaindia.org/blog/can-we-get-the-public-expenditure-management-framework-for-agriculture-sector-right/\"><span>in 2015</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Restructuring of central schemes </strong></p>\n<p><span>In addition, similar to last year’s Union Budget, a series of changes have been proposed in schematic allocations for sector-wide support measures. After RKVY was </span><a href=\"https://www.cbgaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/In-Search-of-Inclusive-Recovery-An-Analysis-of-Union-Budget-2022-23.pdf\"><span>restructured last year</span></a><span>, Union Budget 2023-24 has </span><a href=\"https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/eb/allsbe.pdf\"><span>merged</span></a><span> 10 existing schemes into the Krishionnati Yojana. </span></p>\n<p><span>Consolidation of these schemes will likely increase the quantum of funds available to a basket of state-level, localised interventions rather than having numerous schemes with meagre outlays. But merging these interventions is also likely to impact the existing institutional framework for alternative agricultural practices. </span></p>\n<p><span>Schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, National Food Security Mission, Rainfed Area Development and Climate Change programme, Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation, among others that have been subsumed, specifically address the challenges of rainfed farming. Financial outlays on these merged schemes have also not been laid out in </span><a href=\"https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/OutcomeBudgetE2023_2024.pdf\"><span>Outcome Budget 2023-24</span></a><span>, which makes tracking the progress of these schemes difficult. </span></p>\n<p><span>However, in the latest Union Budget, there seems to be some initiatives to enhance sector-wide support measures such as introduction of a National Mission on Natural Farming and upgrading of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Shrinking base of beneficiaries in individual farmer-centric support</strong></p>\n<p><span>In the latest Union Budget, allocations for both PM-KISAN and PMFBY have declined. It has been mentioned during this year’s budget speech that 114 million farmers benefited from the PM-KISAN scheme. If one assumes that the same number of farmers are to benefit from the scheme in 2023-24, then a budgetary allocation of Rs 68,400 crore is needed for the scheme. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/OutcomeBudgetE2023_2024.pdf\"><span>Outcome Budget 2023-24</span></a><span> mentions a targeted transfer of Rs 67,694 crore to the destination banks. But the </span><a href=\"https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Budget_at_Glance/budget_at_a_glance.pdf\"><span>Budget at a Glance documen</span></a><span>t attributes the downward revision in the budget for the scheme to reduced beneficiary base. This clearly indicates that coverage of the scheme will be lower in 2023-24. </span></p>\n<p><span>Untangling budgetary outlays on agriculture foregrounds the need for a redesign of both Union and state budgets that lays equal emphasis on both sector-wide improvement and individual farmer-centric measures. </span></p>\n<p><span>To this end, an inclusive budgetary paradigm that caters to the marginalised sections of the farming community such as women, landless, tenant, small and marginal farmers and agricultural workers, is the need of the hour.</span></p>\n<p><span><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of </em>Down To Earth.<br></span></p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

Apatanis principally use three rice varieties: Emeo, Pyape and Mypia.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/vale-of-apatanis-56032\">Vale of Apatanis</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The total area of the Apatani Plateau is 10,135 square kilometres, where rice-fish culture is undertaken approximately in 592.0 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice lands out of 715.7 ha.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau is a land of diverse cultures. The major festivals of Apatanis are the Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung. People here believe that these traditional festivals ensure better productivity and well-being.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from humid subtropical to temperate. So, this plateau receives adequate rainfall during the summer season. The permeability and water-retaining capacity of the clayey, loamy soil favour this unique farming technique.</p>\n<p>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a low-input and eco-friendly practice. The stocked fish practically depend on the natural food sources of the rice fields and thus, farmers hardly need to use any supplementary fish feeds.</p>\n<p>The farmers sometimes use household and agricultural wastes and excreta of domestic animals like pigs, cows, mithun (<em>Bos frontalis</em>) and goats to make farming more sustainable and organic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, azolla and lemna are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers. The organic food grown in the field plays an essential role in feeding fish.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/recognise-empower-indigenous-land-tenure-and-title-to-achieve-sdgs-holistically-un-report-75997\">Recognise, empower indigenous land tenure and title to achieve SDGs holistically: UN Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The water sources in these high-altitude rice fields are mountain streams and rainwater trickled down during the monsoon season.</p>\n<p>Bamboo pipes are being used to distribute water from the networks of earthen irrigation channels using two outlet pipes. An outlet is fitted angularly at the upper level through a dyke to maintain the water level and another outlet is fitted at the bottom of the dyke to the exterior. It is used for dewatering the field during harvest.</p>\n<p>Men and women perform different farm duties while preparing the fields for cultivating rice. And during the culture of fish, women folk participate as the major workforce.</p>\n<p>Ancient and old-fashioned agricultural technologies are utilised for cultivation. Modern tools like tractors and power tillers are not affordable as well as inaccessible to the farmers.</p>\n<p>They mostly use agricultural tools such as <em>Dao</em> (sickle) and dibbling sticks. After preparing the field, they transplant a maximum of two-three healthy rice plants with an average distance of 26 cm from each other.</p>\n<p><span>Fish refuges are also created inside the fields. Three strains of fish species of common carp — </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiospecularis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpio communis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpionudus — </span></em><span>are stocked just after ten days from transplanting rice.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492\">Sustainable rice production key to food security</a></span></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The stocked fish are harvested twice in a season. The first and second or final harvest is done in the middle of July and October, respectively. But the rice is harvested at the end of September until the mid of October, i.e. once in a season.</span></p>\n<p><span>Four cultivars of rice are grown along with fish species of </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiol</span></em><span>. The total productivity ranges from 300-500 kilograms of fish per hectare in one season (ha-1 season-1) and 3,000-4,000 kg of rice (ha-1 season-1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish enhances rice productivity (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the mineralisation of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances rice yield here. The records of rice and fish yields were obtained from the farmers through personal interviews.</span></p>\n<p>Dykes at a higher elevation and lower elevation are constructed with a height of 0.9 m to 1.5 m and 0.4 to 0.6 m. These dykes are also used to remove water from the field during harvesting. Bamboo fencing is done to avoid the escape of fish through the pipes.</p>\n<p>This eco-friendly and economically beneficial practice has made the system unique in terms of aquatic resource utilisation.</p>\n<p>The zooplankton and algal life forms serve as natural food sources for the fish in the flooded rice fields to enhance aquatic productivity. This ecosystem service, in turn, indirectly maintains healthy human-made swamps with better livelihood options for tribal framers.</p>\n<p>Field water depth is the limiting factor. All the agro-inputs in this ecosystem with organic manures, decomposed rice stubbles and macrophytes, along with other biotic and abiotic factors, regulate their various population properties in the inundated rice fields.</p>\n<p>For growth and development, the stocked fish in the rice field may have utilised and assimilated available aquatic biomass and zooplankton through trophic interactions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, high-altitude flooded environments enriched with such natural fish feeds have sufficient scope to raise fish as a concurrent crop of rice in the same field.</p>\n<p>In the context of plankton and other fish food organisms, the wet rice fields are still data deficient. The water quality parameters, community structure and population dynamics of algal life forms under the rice canopy are favourable for the growth and abundance of zooplankton, which greatly influences the fish yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such unique integrated farming systems require special attention for better productivity and profitability to the small-scale rural farmers in Assam and other northeastern hill states.</p>\n<h3>Read more:</h3>\n<p><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of</em> Down To Earth</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

A farmer can be termed as the first person to be impacted by climate change since s/he is in a livelihood that directly depends on climate.</p>\n<p>This affects the country’s overall agricultural output and also adds to food inflation. High food prices could result in people slashing down consumption as well. This, on the other hand, impacts negatively on nutritional security.</p>\n<p>Among farming households, a significant number produce food for their own consumption. These households gave birth to the old saying that those who eat their own food are also the healthiest ones.</p>\n<p>For countries like India where malnutrition is high and food insecurity is a nagging constant, such households have used the home production system to remain out of it.</p>\n<p>As many studies point out, these households are also protected from market fluctuations thus ensuring their affordability for healthy food. Obviously, they are not impacted by food inflation as well.</p>\n<p>But serious conversations are taking place over how climate change-induced extreme weather events would impact such households. To begin with, we need to know the linkage between nutrition intake and household food production; and whether weather fluctuation would have any impact on this.</p>\n<p>A recent research paper from the <a href=\"https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136557/filename/136768.pdf\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) attempts to answer the first question: How much do weather conditions impact a home food production system?</p>\n<p>Researchers Hiroyuki Takeshima, Sunil Saroj and Anjani Kumar have analysed village-level data from households on their own food production and consumption and correlated the local weather situations to infer whether there was a significant relationship.</p>\n<p>The IFPRI paper first established that people growing their own food consume more, thus adding to nutrition level and also attaining overall food security. “On average, growing grain crops at home led to Rs 12.184 higher average grain consumption per month per household,” found the research paper.</p>\n<p>This trend is not limited only to grains. Consumption increases significantly for pulses, dairy, vegetables and fruits, if grown at home. The research could establish a link between increased consumption and reduction in child stunting, underweight and women achieving normal body-mass-index. These trends are more pronounced in remote villages.</p>\n<p>But these ‘positive effects’ of growing your own food are observed to be ‘significantly magnified’ if the weather is closer to normal. This is the most definitive linkage of climate and food intake established by this research paper among the food-growing households.</p>\n<p>If the rainfall is one standard deviation closer to the normal figure, grain consumption increases by Rs 12.282. Similarly, if the temperature is one standard deviation from normal, consumption increases by Rs 5.723. This also means that normal weather will increase all other physical benefits.</p>\n<p>This implies that if these households experience adverse weather conditions, their overall food and nutritional security would be negatively impacted. Also, without normal weather, they may have to depend more on markets thus spending more on food than before. This would have an impact on overall economic well being.</p>\n<p>This makes the case for climate-proofing these food producers who till now remain untouched from the crisis. Moreover, these are the people who are yet to be impacted by the market-driven agriculture system. While climate change takes all under its grips, this system of food production needs a prudent reaction.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.
