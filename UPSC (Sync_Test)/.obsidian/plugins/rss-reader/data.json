Religious fanaticism in the State has been raising its ugly head in recent years, and going out of control in recent months, with open calls for violence and threats to state functionaries including Union Ministers. On February 23, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pro-khalistan-leader-amritpal-singhs-supporters-attack-police-in-punjabs-ajnala/article66545817.ece\">a mob overran a police station and freed suspects</a>, which was a <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pro-khalistan-preachers-aide-released-from-jail-a-day-after-his-supporters-clashed-with-police/article66549854.ece\">complete breakdown of law and order</a>. The challenge appears to be daunting for the inexperienced Aam Aadmi Party government, and the situation needs more visible coordination and action by the Centre and the State. The violent campaign in the 1980s for a separate Khalistan, supported by Pakistan, had pulverised the State and claimed the lives of a sitting Prime Minister and thousands of innocents in a genocidal outrage targeting the Sikh community. That trauma should not be allowed to return and torment the community or India. Sikhs are a highly mobile and enterprising community, now spread around the world, but economic and social stagnation is taking its toll. Agriculture is facing a crisis, and drug abuse is rampant. Trouble-makers are smelling an opportunity to incite violence.</p><p>A wound that is allowed to fester will sicken the whole body. The looming trouble in Punjab is being inflamed by a mix of religious fanaticism, foreign-aided opportunism, and a societal crisis. The mobilisation of a section of the Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia for the cause of separatism is also a worrying sign for India. The Centre has to work with Punjab and foreign governments to contain this malaise. Violent tendencies must be nipped in the bud and proponents of hate must pay a price. Also, there has to be a conscious effort to communicate with the Sikh community at large to isolate the toxic elements. To the world and to citizens, the message must be clear that India remains a multireligious and multicultural nation that does not tolerate or require separatism. A lack of trust between the farmers of Punjab and the Centre had derailed the agriculture laws that sought to reform the sector in 2021. A combination of strict force against violent elements and trust-building with the general public should be at the heart of the rhetoric and policy of the government. At any rate, no rhetoric from any quarter should be encouraged that causes more alienation.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

However, it was not the India-Japan Special Strategic and Global Partnership that was at the heart of the Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s mission during his quick “official visit” to Delhi this week. His focus was on two areas: coordinating the G-7 and G-20 agendas on food and energy security issues arising mainly from the Ukraine conflict as well as unveiling Japan’s $75 billion plan for a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), to work with countries in the region on avoiding debt traps, building infrastructure, and enhancing maritime and air security. Mr. Kishida appeared to be emphasising the need for a global consensus, especially including India, in tackling the challenges from Russia and China, where Japan is aligned with western powers. In talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Kishida is understood to have been “straightforward” about the need for India, as G-20 president, to come on board with the G-7’s plans to address the Ukraine issue and call out “Russian aggression”. While he did not name China directly, it is clear that Chinese actions in its neighbourhood have left Japan concerned, and his FOIP plan includes India as an “indispensable partner”. The timing of his visit was also pointed, coinciding with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Moscow visit. And, as Mr. Xi met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a show of strength on Tuesday, Mr. Kishida flew to Kiev to support Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his first such visit since the war began.\r</p><p>For New Delhi, that has close ties with Tokyo, as bilateral and multilateral cooperation (the Quad), Mr. Kishida was a welcome guest. The two countries have many collaborations that include the Japanese loan for the much-delayed “Bullet train” project, and plans to work on infrastructure projects to link Bangladesh and India’s northeast. As presidents of the G-7 and G-20, both nations have much to gain from synchronising priorities and ensuring that the Global South gets its fair share of the outcomes of both summits. An end to the Ukraine war and a pushback against China’s aggression in its neighbourhood are also common goals. However, it would be wrong to assume that they share similar positions on them. Unlike India, Japan is part of the U.S.’s alliance. Japan has also joined sanctions against Russia, while India has refused to do so. India has been vocal about its concerns over China’s actions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) but reticent in directly criticising China’s actions in the South China Sea, Taiwan Straits, etc. With Mr. Modi set to visit Hiroshima as a G-7 special invitee in May, and later host Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin at the Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, any shift in New Delhi’s tightrope balancing act on geopolitical issues would seem a stretch, even at the behest of a dear partner like Japan.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

          "content": "<body class=\"art\" morss_own_score=\"2.423855963990998\" morss_score=\"23.91091404479908\"><h1>\nReverse the hostility: on the confrontation between the government and the Opposition in Kerala\n</h1><h3>The incidents in Kerala’s Assembly could have been avoided if the Speaker remained non-partisan</h3><p> March 21, 2023 12:20 am | Updated 11:57 am IST </p><p>Adversarial relations between the ruling party and the Opposition are inevitable in a democracy and, in a way, such relations that bring strong differences of opinion and contentious views to the fore are critical. Democracy flourishes when there is reconciliation through legislative debate. Yet, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/two-congress-legislators-and-few-wardens-hospitalised-following-bedlam-in-kerala-assembly/article66622098.ece\">adversarial relations resulting in confrontation</a> following the lack of discourse over differences on issues of public import, speak poorly of legislative conduct. This holds true of Kerala, where legislative business has come to a standstill after a severe deterioration in relations between the ruling coalition and the Opposition. What began as an issue of the Speaker repeatedly disallowing discussion on Rule 50 notices by the Opposition United Democratic Front last week has grown into <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/opposition-disrupts-kerala-assembly-demanding-action-against-those-responsible-for-wednesdays-assault/article66625741.ece\">a full-blown confrontation</a>, with legal cases being filed against legislators after incidents that resulted in a ruckus in the Assembly. A case can be made that it ill behoves the Opposition to resort to parodying Assembly proceedings after the Speaker’s denials or to protest in an unparliamentary way against the Chair, currently held by A.N. Shamseer. But the onus is on the Speaker and the ruling front to ensure that the Opposition’s legislative privilege to have discussions on pressing issues is respected and allowed. Clearly, the repeated denial of <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/assembly-chaos-opposition-and-ruling-front-clash-over-life-mission-corruption-case/article66562900.ece\">discussions on Rule 50 notices</a> and the filing of serious legal cases against Opposition members have only deepened the confrontation. Other grievances expressed by the Opposition that their legislators do not get sufficient play on Sabha TV, the official broadcaster, also seem to have merit.</p><p>On Monday, the Speaker struck a conciliatory note by expunging remarks made by him against a Congress legislator. He also assured the Opposition that he would uphold their rights that included the privilege to move Rule 50 notices on matters of “vital public importance” and ensure that the Assembly broadcaster was non-partisan. This should be the cue for both sides to begin a dialogue leading to the reversal of vituperative legal actions and the resumption of normal legislative discourse. Kerala is India’s bellwether on socio-economic issues, but it faces unique challenges as an ecologically fragile State that has to work on a balance between development and ecological sustainability, as the Brahmapuram fire incident also exemplified. Healthy discussion and debate over ideas, even if adversarial, would go a long way in ensuring good governance by keeping the LDF government on its toes. How the ruling coalition and, by extension, the Chief Minister, responds to the Opposition’s call for non-partisan conduct of legislative proceedings will determine the course of normalisation of relations between the two fronts in the State.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The United Nations has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Budget speech in February, singled them out as ‘Shree Anna’ — roughly translated as the ‘best among grains’ — adding that the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/government-to-support-hyderabad-based-millet-institute-as-centre-of-excellence-fm-sitharaman/article66457471.ece\">Indian Institute of Millets Research in Hyderabad would be supported as a centre of excellence</a>.</p><p>Millets such as sorghum, bajra and ragi are strongly linked to Indian dietary traditions, which is why the country has for long been the largest producer of millets in the world. It is no surprise that this cereal family is popular because it is energy dense, can be grown with ease in arid soils and, relative to grains such as rice, wheat and maize, is less susceptible to pests. Why such a ‘super food’ got sidelined by the Green Revolution of the 1960s in favour of rice and wheat has little to do with nutrition and more with the development of high yielding varieties of rice and wheat, that produced twice or thrice per acre. Coupled with guaranteed procurement by the government, the rice-wheat combination enabled India to be food secure even in droughts and climate blights. However, this food security came at a cost such as the wanton exploitation of groundwater, a surfeit of pesticide-use, and ossified systems of grain production and procurement that, over the years, is decreasingly remunerative for the average farmer. With average global incomes having risen since the 1960s and rising demand for ‘sustainable agriculture’, India is looking to market millet as a global panacea. However, competing with the global rice-wheat-maize troika, which according to the Food and Agriculture Organization constitutes 89% of global cereal production, means that millet production must be many times more remunerative than now. Hybrid varieties of jowar and bajra exist, and that yields have not dramatically risen in decades despite this means that it would be unrealistic to expect quantum jumps in yield from technological tweaks alone. Dietary shifts are slow processes and promoting certain grains as ‘superior’ or inferior is self-defeating as it ignores the economics of production and promotes cycles of hype — as seen in cash crops. This can have consequences for marginal farmers. Letting all grains grow and helping a wider base of consumers access the cereal they want is a more sustainable enterprise.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

          "description": "Higher credit costs may further dampen consumption ",
          "content": "<body class=\"art\" morss_own_score=\"2.378432351472791\" morss_score=\"23.863417336457772\"><h1>\nSpectre of stagflation: On the overall macroeconomic outlook\n</h1><h3>Higher credit costs may further dampen consumption </h3><p> March 20, 2023 12:20 am | Updated 11:35 am IST </p><p>The latest global financial developments and recent economic data in India are together raising fears that several major economies worldwide, including India’s, may be headed for a spell of debilitating stagflation. Last week’s retail inflation reading for February from India’s NSO, at 6.44%, clearly belies the RBI’s most recent forecast for Q4 inflation of 5.7%. With January having logged CPI-based price gains of 6.52%, prices will have to soften so sharply in March as to drag the headline number down by more than 230 basis points to about 4.1% for the RBI’s projection to come true. A look at the components driving inflation shows that core inflation, which strips out the impact of food and fuel prices, still remains stuck at 6.2% for a third straight month, and continues to hover almost at or above the 6% level since May 2021. That core inflation remains persistently elevated despite the RBI having raised its benchmark interest rate by 250 basis points since last May reveals the difficulty monetary authorities are facing in tamping down on price gains by increasing credit costs so as to dampen demand. Governor Shaktikanta Das and the RBI’s two other members on the Monetary Policy Committee all cited the worrying persistence of core inflation at their last policy meeting in February as justification for deciding to continue tightening monetary policy.</p><p>Queering the pitch further is price gains across the food basket too showing disconcerting trends despite a marginal deceleration of five basis points last month in the composite food price index. Prices of four key categories in the food basket that together account for more than a fifth of the Consumer Price Index continued to register significantly high year-on-year inflation, as well as sequential hardening. If the key staple of cereals and products saw inflation accelerate to 16.7% in February, the headline reading for milk and products quickened to 9.65%, that for fruits surged to 6.38% (from January’s 2.93%), with only the reading for spices slowing a tad to 20.2% (from 21.1%). With the prediction of a likely El Niño this year, the outlook for food prices is hardly reassuring. While policymakers will, therefore, need to stay focused on containing inflation, the rising uncertainty about the growth momentum sustaining in the face of the heightened risks of a recession in advanced economies raises the risk that higher credit costs may further dampen consumption. Yet, failure to engender enduring price stability could lead to stagflation. Unless supply side measures such as GST rationalisation and fuel price cuts are expedited, the overall macroeconomic outlook appears worrying.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

This was not the first fire at Brahmapuram. Studies by the CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, in 2019 and 2020, concluded that the many fires released highly toxic substances into their surroundings; they are also likely to have been released in this fire. These facts indicate two problems — solid waste accumulated at the site, and it was not removed quickly enough. And, also, two kinds of failure. First, Kochi’s solid-waste management apparatus is too tenuous for the amount of waste it produces and the Brahmapuram waste-to-energy plant is dysfunctional. The former is a pan-India problem, due to overconsumption, low resource-use efficiency, and not handling such waste properly. Solid waste can be biodegradable, when it is composted, or nonbiodegradable, when it is repurposed, combusted, or landfilled. Such waste does not go anywhere else; so, if any of these three channels are clogged, waste will collect in the others. This is why landfills are signs of urban dysfunction. The second kind has to do with waste not being removed efficiently from stockpiles — by feeding it into waste-to-energy plants and by recovering commercially important metals, refuse-derived fuel, and bio-soil — and by storing the flammable waste in a way that would not prevent fires.\r</p><p>The Brahmapuram plant appears to have been in the State’s blind spot. Such facilities work only when the relatively more expensive power they produce will be purchased; the amount of combustible waste they receive is proportional to the amount of purchasable power they can produce; and the waste they receive has sufficient caloric content to produce that power. The plant is dysfunctional: the State must explain why and revive it. Also needed are answers about the landfilling and biomining contracts, why contractors failed their obligations, and why course-correction was not effected sooner. It is of concern that the State overlooked Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal orders to prevent such fires. Corruption in the face of the climate crisis beggars cynicism. Finally, Kerala needs to discard centralised waste-processing in favour of the decentralised mode encouraged by its Solid Waste Management Policy. The State is unlikely to meet its goal of being waste-free by 2026 if it does not achieve its circular economies, which it will not unless its trash mountains dwindle instead of becoming climate pollutants in their own right.\r</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

          "content": "<body class=\"art\" morss_own_score=\"2.4522132796780682\" morss_score=\"24.176618431391667\"><h1>\nReverse the hostility: on the confrontation between the government and the Opposition in Kerala\n</h1><h3>The incidents in Kerala’s Assembly could have been avoided if the Speaker remained non-partisan</h3><p> March 21, 2023 12:20 am | Updated 07:41 am IST </p><p>Adversarial relations between the ruling party and the Opposition are inevitable in a democracy and, in a way, such relations that bring strong differences of opinion and contentious views to the fore are critical. Democracy flourishes when there is reconciliation through legislative debate. Yet, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/two-congress-legislators-and-few-wardens-hospitalised-following-bedlam-in-kerala-assembly/article66622098.ece\">adversarial relations resulting in confrontation</a> following the lack of discourse over differences on issues of public import, speak poorly of legislative conduct. This holds true of Kerala, where legislative business has come to a standstill after a severe deterioration in relations between the ruling coalition and the Opposition. What began as an issue of the Speaker repeatedly disallowing discussion on Rule 50 notices by the Opposition United Democratic Front last week has grown into <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/opposition-disrupts-kerala-assembly-demanding-action-against-those-responsible-for-wednesdays-assault/article66625741.ece\">a full-blown confrontation</a>, with legal cases being filed against legislators after incidents that resulted in a ruckus in the Assembly. A case can be made that it ill behoves the Opposition to resort to parodying Assembly proceedings after the Speaker’s denials or to protest in an unparliamentary way against the Chair, currently held by A.N. Shamseer. But the onus is on the Speaker and the ruling front to ensure that the Opposition’s legislative privilege to have discussions on pressing issues is respected and allowed. Clearly, the repeated denial of <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/assembly-chaos-opposition-and-ruling-front-clash-over-life-mission-corruption-case/article66562900.ece\">discussions on Rule 50 notices</a> and the filing of serious legal cases against Opposition members have only deepened the confrontation. Other grievances expressed by the Opposition that their legislators do not get sufficient play on Sabha TV, the official broadcaster, also seem to have merit.</p><p>On Monday, the Speaker struck a conciliatory note by expunging remarks made by him against a Congress legislator. He also assured the Opposition that he would uphold their rights that included the privilege to move Rule 50 notices on matters of “vital public importance” and ensure that the Assembly broadcaster was non-partisan. This should be the cue for both sides to begin a dialogue leading to the reversal of vituperative legal actions and the resumption of normal legislative discourse. Kerala is India’s bellwether on socio-economic issues, but it faces unique challenges as an ecologically fragile State that has to work on a balance between development and ecological sustainability, as the Brahmapuram fire incident also exemplified. Healthy discussion and debate over ideas, even if adversarial, would go a long way in ensuring good governance by keeping the LDF government on its toes. How the ruling coalition and, by extension, the Chief Minister, responds to the Opposition’s call for non-partisan conduct of legislative proceedings will determine the course of normalisation of relations between the two fronts in the State.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The United Nations has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Budget speech in February, singled them out as ‘Shree Anna’ — roughly translated as the ‘best among grains’ — adding that the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/government-to-support-hyderabad-based-millet-institute-as-centre-of-excellence-fm-sitharaman/article66457471.ece\">Indian Institute of Millets Research in Hyderabad would be supported as a centre of excellence</a>.</p><p>Millets such as sorghum, bajra and ragi are strongly linked to Indian dietary traditions, which is why the country has for long been the largest producer of millets in the world. It is no surprise that this cereal family is popular because it is energy dense, can be grown with ease in arid soils and, relative to grains such as rice, wheat and maize, is less susceptible to pests. Why such a ‘super food’ got sidelined by the Green Revolution of the 1960s in favour of rice and wheat has little to do with nutrition and more with the development of high yielding varieties of rice and wheat, that produced twice or thrice per acre. Coupled with guaranteed procurement by the government, the rice-wheat combination enabled India to be food secure even in droughts and climate blights. However, this food security came at a cost such as the wanton exploitation of groundwater, a surfeit of pesticide-use, and ossified systems of grain production and procurement that, over the years, is decreasingly remunerative for the average farmer. With average global incomes having risen since the 1960s and rising demand for ‘sustainable agriculture’, India is looking to market millet as a global panacea. However, competing with the global rice-wheat-maize troika, which according to the Food and Agriculture Organization constitutes 89% of global cereal production, means that millet production must be many times more remunerative than now. Hybrid varieties of jowar and bajra exist, and that yields have not dramatically risen in decades despite this means that it would be unrealistic to expect quantum jumps in yield from technological tweaks alone. Dietary shifts are slow processes and promoting certain grains as ‘superior’ or inferior is self-defeating as it ignores the economics of production and promotes cycles of hype — as seen in cash crops. This can have consequences for marginal farmers. Letting all grains grow and helping a wider base of consumers access the cereal they want is a more sustainable enterprise.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Last week’s retail inflation reading for February from India’s NSO, at 6.44%, clearly belies the RBI’s most recent forecast for Q4 inflation of 5.7%. With January having logged CPI-based price gains of 6.52%, prices will have to soften so sharply in March as to drag the headline number down by more than 230 basis points to about 4.1% for the RBI’s projection to come true. A look at the components driving inflation shows that core inflation, which strips out the impact of food and fuel prices, still remains stuck at 6.2% for a third straight month, and continues to hover almost at or above the 6% level since May 2021. That core inflation remains persistently elevated despite the RBI having raised its benchmark interest rate by 250 basis points since last May reveals the difficulty monetary authorities are facing in tamping down on price gains by increasing credit costs so as to dampen demand. Governor Shaktikanta Das and the RBI’s two other members on the Monetary Policy Committee all cited the worrying persistence of core inflation at their last policy meeting in February as justification for deciding to continue tightening monetary policy.</p><p>Queering the pitch further is price gains across the food basket too showing disconcerting trends despite a marginal deceleration of five basis points last month in the composite food price index. Prices of four key categories in the food basket that together account for more than a fifth of the Consumer Price Index continued to register significantly high year-on-year inflation, as well as sequential hardening. If the key staple of cereals and products saw inflation accelerate to 16.7% in February, the headline reading for milk and products quickened to 9.65%, that for fruits surged to 6.38% (from January’s 2.93%), with only the reading for spices slowing a tad to 20.2% (from 21.1%). With the prediction of a likely El Niño this year, the outlook for food prices is hardly reassuring. While policymakers will, therefore, need to stay focused on containing inflation, the rising uncertainty about the growth momentum sustaining in the face of the heightened risks of a recession in advanced economies raises the risk that higher credit costs may further dampen consumption. Yet, failure to engender enduring price stability could lead to stagflation. Unless supply side measures such as GST rationalisation and fuel price cuts are expedited, the overall macroeconomic outlook appears worrying.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Available evidence suggests that Mr. Gandhi had categorically stated that the challenges to Indian democracy had to be sorted out domestically, and ruled out any role for foreign forces. With the Indian diaspora expanding, the ripple effects of politics in India are inevitable beyond the country’s geographical boundaries. In fact, the BJP has for long believed in cultural nationalism which is not contained within the geography of India. Mr. Modi has discussed national politics before audiences around the world. A democracy that does not allow criticism, including of democracy itself, is a contradiction in terms. Mr. Gandhi has not been able to speak in Parliament and explain his remarks; meanwhile, a BJP Member has initiated a process to terminate Mr. Gandhi’s Lok Sabha membership. It is an ill-advised move, and if carried out, will further amplify the fears of a democratic deficit in India.</p><p>In their clamour for an apology by Mr. Gandhi, BJP Ministers are also evading questions regarding government patronage of the Adani Group. The Congress has been seeking answers from the government on the links between the public sector Life Insurance Corporation of India and the State Bank of India with the Adani Group. The BJP and the government have been silent on this serious issue of governance that spans the government and the public and private sectors. Arbitrariness in decision making, followed by a lack of accountability, amounts to governance failure, if not collusion. The government, the Rajya Sabha chairman and the Lok Sabha Speaker should work with the Opposition for a discussion on the issues arising out of the Adani controversy. Coming clean is essential in maintaining the government’s credibility, the regulatory environment and the private sector. There have been precedents of a JPC in cases of financial scandals. The BJP has the numbers to get away with any disregard for parliamentary norms, but it should rise above that temptation and evolve as a true party of governance. Parliament has a role to play in fixing accountability, and the BJP should not avoid it and betray a new level of executive impunity.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-moves-supreme-court-accusing-governor-of-delaying-assent-to-bills/article66618109.ece\">Supreme Court will soon hear an extraordinary petition</a> from the Telangana government, seeking a direction to the Governor, Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan, to grant assent to Bills passed by the State Assembly. Recently, the <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-governor-had-already-summoned-assembly-session-on-march-3-sg-tushar-mehta-tells-supreme-court/article66563352.ece\">apex court disposed of a petition from the Punjab Government</a> that was aggrieved by an alleged delay in the Governor summoning the Assembly. The matter was resolved when it was submitted on behalf of the Governor that the Assembly would meet on the day desired by the State government. In earlier decades, a petition seeking a direction to Governors or questioning their inaction on constitutional matters would have been thrown out at the threshold itself. However, such is the extent to which the gubernatorial office is being overtly politicised by those holding it that courts may now be constrained to examine whether such inaction is justified. One sees a disturbing tendency in recent years of some Governors making use of the absence of a time-frame in the Constitution to indefinitely delay decisions. This tactic effectively stalls the elected regime’s legislative agenda.</p><p>The conflict between Raj Bhavan and the Chief Minister’s office witnessed in several States is quite acute in Telangana. Dr. Soundararajan has alleged that she is being boycotted by Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao and that her queries are not being answered. The State government, for its part, is apparently upset that she may be trying to act independent of the Cabinet. A recent tweet from her account the day after the State government went to court — conveying a message that Raj Bhavan was closer than Delhi — indicates that her stand is linked to her view that the government is unfriendly and discourteous. These considerations ought not to matter on constitutional issues. The Governor can either grant assent to a Bill or decline it, or reserve it for the President’s consideration. In suitable cases, it may also be returned for reconsideration. However, none of this should be based on the Governor’s personal view on the Bill’s content. One can understand an occasional query if any Bill seemingly violates fundamental rights, but a relevant question that requires an authoritative pronouncement from the court is whether the Governor should decide on its legality or the legislature’s competence each time a Bill is presented for assent. As the Supreme Court remarked recently, dialogue between constitutional functionaries should not become a race to the bottom. Constitutional functions should not be held hostage to political and personal differences.</p><h5>\nRelated Topics\n</h5><h2><span>\nTop News Today\n</span></h2> <img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png\"><h3>Comments</h3><p>Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

But the Supreme Court decision provided some relief to the EPFO which reduced the number of members/ pensioners who could gain from higher pension options.</p>\n<p>An official said the government is still in the process of figuring out the actuarial deficit post the Supreme Court decision. “It will be higher than what is stated in the latest annual report of the EPFO, but will definitely not be as high as Rs 15 lakh crore projected after the Kerala High Court judgement,” the official said.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/old-pension-scheme-employees-unions-firm-on-indefinite-strike-from-today-8495145/\">Old pension scheme: Employees’ unions firm on indefinite strike from today</a></div>\n<p>The total number of pensioners under EPS has more than doubled to 72.73 lakh in 2021-22 compared with 35.10 lakh in 2009-10. “In the coming years, given India’s demographic dividend, the inflows to the pension fund of the EPS are expected to be high given the addition to its membership. But when this progressively tapers off, the number of pensioners will be disproportionate to the number of existing members or new entrants. This is when the problem will kick in,” said another official in the government.</p>\n<p>According to Report of the Technical Group on Population Projections for India and States 2011-2036, 73.5 crore people or 60.7 per cent of India’s population was in the working age group — 15-59 years —in 2011 and this population group is expected to increase to 98.85 crore in 2036. While the working age population is likely to then taper off, due to increasing longevity, India’s population in the age group of 60 years and above is projected to increase from 10.15 crore in 2011 to 22.74 crore in 2036.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In the Supreme Court, the EPFO is learnt to have cited an actual calculation of 21,000 pensioners, detailing the difference between their contributions and upfront payment of pension arrears to be over Rs 250 crore.

The net liability for the preceding year as on March 31, 2014 was Rs 7,832.74 crore.</p>\n<p>The value of the pension fund corpus stood at Rs 3.18 lakh crore as per the combined report for 2016 and 2017, while the present value of future contribution stood Rs 4.04 lakh crore. This sums up to Rs 7.22 lakh crore, which when seen against the present value of benefits of Rs 7.38 lakh crore, resulted in a net liability of Rs 15,531.91 crore.</p>\n<p>A detailed query sent to the EPFO by <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com\">The Indian Express</a> on this issue remained unanswered.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-economics/what-is-the-higher-pension-option-offered-by-epfo-8461387/\">What is the higher pension option offered by EPFO?</a></div>\n<p>Trade unions have flagged concerns about the link provided by the EPFO to exercise the option for higher pension, stating it first asks whether the subscriber had opted for higher pension benefit while joining the EPS-95 scheme, which most had not opted for and thus, the link is programmed to deny the benefits of the Supreme Court ruling to the eligible pensioners.</p>\n\n<span>Explained</span><h2>Why pension is a worry</h2><p>The actuarial deficit, or the difference between the net present value of benefits and contributions of all members, may be manageable now, but is expected to rise sharply in coming decades as the number of pensioners swell. The government is keen to ensure this does not jeopardise social security for low wage earners.</p>\n<p>In a series of letters to the EPFO earlier this month, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) had also raised doubts on the disclaimers put out on the portal. In its letter, it mentioned how the subscribers opting for the higher pension benefit have to undertake a declaration empowering the Central government to amend the scheme “as it may deem fit”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>“As such, the pension calculation formula has already been specified/defined in the Scheme…then why is such a disclaimer inserted?” the letter said. Some pensioners have also filed review petitions in various state high courts.</p>\n<p>The EPFO has extended the deadline to opt for higher pension to May 3 from the March deadline earlier. The Supreme Court in a ruling on November 4 had upheld the amendments to the Employees’ Pension (Amendment) Scheme, 2014, implying another chance for employees who were existing EPS members as on September 1, 2014 to contribute up to 8.33 per cent of their ‘actual’ salaries — as against 8.33 per cent of the pensionable salary capped at Rs 15,000 a month — towards pension.</p><div>Also Read</div><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The EPS provides employees with pension after the age of 58, if they have rendered at least 10 years of service and retired at age 58. The monthly pension is computed based on this formula: Monthly pension = pensionable salary x pensionable service / 70, on a pro-rata basis linked to maximum monthly pensionable salary of Rs 6,500 for pensionable service up to September 1, 2014 and Rs 15,000 thereafter.</p>\n</div> ",

Apatanis principally use three rice varieties: Emeo, Pyape and Mypia.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/vale-of-apatanis-56032\">Vale of Apatanis</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The total area of the Apatani Plateau is 10,135 square kilometres, where rice-fish culture is undertaken approximately in 592.0 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice lands out of 715.7 ha.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau is a land of diverse cultures. The major festivals of Apatanis are the Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung. People here believe that these traditional festivals ensure better productivity and well-being.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from humid subtropical to temperate. So, this plateau receives adequate rainfall during the summer season. The permeability and water-retaining capacity of the clayey, loamy soil favour this unique farming technique.</p>\n<p>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a low-input and eco-friendly practice. The stocked fish practically depend on the natural food sources of the rice fields and thus, farmers hardly need to use any supplementary fish feeds.</p>\n<p>The farmers sometimes use household and agricultural wastes and excreta of domestic animals like pigs, cows, mithun (<em>Bos frontalis</em>) and goats to make farming more sustainable and organic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, azolla and lemna are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers. The organic food grown in the field plays an essential role in feeding fish.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/recognise-empower-indigenous-land-tenure-and-title-to-achieve-sdgs-holistically-un-report-75997\">Recognise, empower indigenous land tenure and title to achieve SDGs holistically: UN Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The water sources in these high-altitude rice fields are mountain streams and rainwater trickled down during the monsoon season.</p>\n<p>Bamboo pipes are being used to distribute water from the networks of earthen irrigation channels using two outlet pipes. An outlet is fitted angularly at the upper level through a dyke to maintain the water level and another outlet is fitted at the bottom of the dyke to the exterior. It is used for dewatering the field during harvest.</p>\n<p>Men and women perform different farm duties while preparing the fields for cultivating rice. And during the culture of fish, women folk participate as the major workforce.</p>\n<p>Ancient and old-fashioned agricultural technologies are utilised for cultivation. Modern tools like tractors and power tillers are not affordable as well as inaccessible to the farmers.</p>\n<p>They mostly use agricultural tools such as <em>Dao</em> (sickle) and dibbling sticks. After preparing the field, they transplant a maximum of two-three healthy rice plants with an average distance of 26 cm from each other.</p>\n<p><span>Fish refuges are also created inside the fields. Three strains of fish species of common carp — </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiospecularis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpio communis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpionudus — </span></em><span>are stocked just after ten days from transplanting rice.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492\">Sustainable rice production key to food security</a></span></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The stocked fish are harvested twice in a season. The first and second or final harvest is done in the middle of July and October, respectively. But the rice is harvested at the end of September until the mid of October, i.e. once in a season.</span></p>\n<p><span>Four cultivars of rice are grown along with fish species of </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiol</span></em><span>. The total productivity ranges from 300-500 kilograms of fish per hectare in one season (ha-1 season-1) and 3,000-4,000 kg of rice (ha-1 season-1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish enhances rice productivity (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the mineralisation of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances rice yield here. The records of rice and fish yields were obtained from the farmers through personal interviews.</span></p>\n<p>Dykes at a higher elevation and lower elevation are constructed with a height of 0.9 m to 1.5 m and 0.4 to 0.6 m. These dykes are also used to remove water from the field during harvesting. Bamboo fencing is done to avoid the escape of fish through the pipes.</p>\n<p>This eco-friendly and economically beneficial practice has made the system unique in terms of aquatic resource utilisation.</p>\n<p>The zooplankton and algal life forms serve as natural food sources for the fish in the flooded rice fields to enhance aquatic productivity. This ecosystem service, in turn, indirectly maintains healthy human-made swamps with better livelihood options for tribal framers.</p>\n<p>Field water depth is the limiting factor. All the agro-inputs in this ecosystem with organic manures, decomposed rice stubbles and macrophytes, along with other biotic and abiotic factors, regulate their various population properties in the inundated rice fields.</p>\n<p>For growth and development, the stocked fish in the rice field may have utilised and assimilated available aquatic biomass and zooplankton through trophic interactions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, high-altitude flooded environments enriched with such natural fish feeds have sufficient scope to raise fish as a concurrent crop of rice in the same field.</p>\n<p>In the context of plankton and other fish food organisms, the wet rice fields are still data deficient. The water quality parameters, community structure and population dynamics of algal life forms under the rice canopy are favourable for the growth and abundance of zooplankton, which greatly influences the fish yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such unique integrated farming systems require special attention for better productivity and profitability to the small-scale rural farmers in Assam and other northeastern hill states.</p>\n<h3>Read more:</h3>\n<p><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of</em> Down To Earth</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

A farmer can be termed as the first person to be impacted by climate change since s/he is in a livelihood that directly depends on climate.</p>\n<p>This affects the country’s overall agricultural output and also adds to food inflation. High food prices could result in people slashing down consumption as well. This, on the other hand, impacts negatively on nutritional security.</p>\n<p>Among farming households, a significant number produce food for their own consumption. These households gave birth to the old saying that those who eat their own food are also the healthiest ones.</p>\n<p>For countries like India where malnutrition is high and food insecurity is a nagging constant, such households have used the home production system to remain out of it.</p>\n<p>As many studies point out, these households are also protected from market fluctuations thus ensuring their affordability for healthy food. Obviously, they are not impacted by food inflation as well.</p>\n<p>But serious conversations are taking place over how climate change-induced extreme weather events would impact such households. To begin with, we need to know the linkage between nutrition intake and household food production; and whether weather fluctuation would have any impact on this.</p>\n<p>A recent research paper from the <a href=\"https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136557/filename/136768.pdf\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) attempts to answer the first question: How much do weather conditions impact a home food production system?</p>\n<p>Researchers Hiroyuki Takeshima, Sunil Saroj and Anjani Kumar have analysed village-level data from households on their own food production and consumption and correlated the local weather situations to infer whether there was a significant relationship.</p>\n<p>The IFPRI paper first established that people growing their own food consume more, thus adding to nutrition level and also attaining overall food security. “On average, growing grain crops at home led to Rs 12.184 higher average grain consumption per month per household,” found the research paper.</p>\n<p>This trend is not limited only to grains. Consumption increases significantly for pulses, dairy, vegetables and fruits, if grown at home. The research could establish a link between increased consumption and reduction in child stunting, underweight and women achieving normal body-mass-index. These trends are more pronounced in remote villages.</p>\n<p>But these ‘positive effects’ of growing your own food are observed to be ‘significantly magnified’ if the weather is closer to normal. This is the most definitive linkage of climate and food intake established by this research paper among the food-growing households.</p>\n<p>If the rainfall is one standard deviation closer to the normal figure, grain consumption increases by Rs 12.282. Similarly, if the temperature is one standard deviation from normal, consumption increases by Rs 5.723. This also means that normal weather will increase all other physical benefits.</p>\n<p>This implies that if these households experience adverse weather conditions, their overall food and nutritional security would be negatively impacted. Also, without normal weather, they may have to depend more on markets thus spending more on food than before. This would have an impact on overall economic well being.</p>\n<p>This makes the case for climate-proofing these food producers who till now remain untouched from the crisis. Moreover, these are the people who are yet to be impacted by the market-driven agriculture system. While climate change takes all under its grips, this system of food production needs a prudent reaction.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

          "content": "<section name=\"articleBody\" class=\"meteredContent css-1r7ky0e\" morss_own_score=\"9.983122362869198\" morss_score=\"24.963320382671178\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"19.0\"><p><em>When my father died, my family took photos of his body before he was cremated. The photos were of him at home, peaceful in bed; my mother wanted to tenderly remember him both in life and in his death. My partner at the time uploaded these photos to their computer, storing these and other images in their cloud server as we archived memories from the trip home to say goodbye to my father.</em></p><p><em>One evening later that year, my then-partner pulled up the photos and did a slide show of our trip for their family. When my partner got to the images of my father’s dead body, they went through every image instead of skipping over them. It was immensely painful, compounded by the fact that my father is a Black man and these images were being shown to an affluent white family. The race and class dynamics here were staggering — it felt as if this white family was viewing these images as entertainment. This was among the incidents that triggered my ending the relationship; my ex didn’t quite understand why this was inappropriate or painful.</em></p><p><em>As we were breaking up, I asked that they erase the images from their drive. Since that time, they’ve made a million excuses as to why they can’t erase the images — the drive is in storage, they’ve moved, etc. It’s now been nearly six years. Still, I am deeply disturbed by the lack of control I have over these images. Currently my ex lives in the U.K., and I live in the U.S. What is the correct course of action here? Do I let it go? Seek legal action? My great fear is that these images will circulate into the future without my or my family’s consent. </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>Your letter raises a number of issues, not least about your and your ex’s differing experiences of this slide show. Perhaps, in your judgment, this family wouldn’t have used the image of a white person of their class background in this way. If so, then this was indeed a case of the “racially based disregard for the welfare of certain people” that the philosopher Jorge L. A. Garcia once identified as “the heart of racism.”</p></div><p>Perhaps you feel that even if the family would have treated pictures of a deceased white person in the same manner, doing so would have been less unseemly because of the history of the abuse of images of Black suffering and death by white people (not least the lynching photographs that circulated around the turn of the 20th century). An awareness of that history may well have conditioned your response. Still, they were seeing these images in the context of a family member’s visit to the funeral of a partner. Details matter, and not knowing exactly how your ex’s family reacted to the pictures, I can’t say whether your appalled response was justified.</p><p>What’s incontestable is that you’ve been greatly pained by what happened. Whether or not your ex understood your reaction, they should have complied with your request. Your ex doesn’t own these images and isn’t entitled to circulate them without permission. Indeed, the person who took the photographs could formally register the copyright, and a lawyer’s letter could be sent giving formal notice that the copyright holder asks that these images not be reproduced or publicly circulated. That would at least further underline the seriousness with which you regard the issue.</p><p>Given that these images don’t seem to have been further circulated, though, it’s unclear what grounds you’d have for pursuing legal action. How would you even establish their continued existence? Which brings us to a curious feature of your situation. At any point, your ex could simply have claimed to have deleted them; you had no way to verify this claim. Yet you’ve been denied this assurance, real or spurious. You’re not being told no; you’re being told “not yet.” The natural inference is that your ex wants to maintain a status quo in which you’re regularly in touch.</p><p>Letting go of this issue — if you can manage it, psychologically — means letting go of your ex. That’s the main reason I’d urge you to try. Six years after your breakup, your demands, however legitimate, are keeping you in each other’s lives. That outcome may suit your ex. I don’t think it suits you.</p><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous column’s question was from a woman whose neighbors regularly left their young child outside, sometimes in foul weather, screaming and crying.

I believe that a better-functioning labor market will be beneficial for the country’s citizens and perhaps help hasten democracy there. I cannot be sure, however, that the data that I would recommend them to collect would only be used for the public good and be immune from manipulation. I would certainly strongly advise the use of measures to protect survey respondents and ensure that they can respond accurately. But the country lacks the democratic institutions that would enforce these protections. What’s more, improvements for the populace could strengthen the current regime’s power, instead of hastening democracy.</em></p><p><em>Should I refuse to participate in this project, or do I participate and do what I can to help the lives of the people living in this country? </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>The project is going ahead with or without you, and your participation could mitigate some of its possible downsides. So, from a consequentialist perspective, participating is the better choice. Consequences aren’t all that matters, to be sure. It’s perfectly reasonable to decide that you’re not the kind of person who would participate in a vile project, even if your participation would make the outcome slightly better. (The philosopher Bernard Williams, in an influential discussion of integrity, posed the example of a chemist who was reluctant to take a job involved with chemical and biological weapons, even if he, unlike an alternate candidate, might be able to slow down the weapons program a bit.) I don’t see this as being an issue here, however. The project may lead to some bad effects, but it’s being done with good intentions. It sounds as if the development institution and the people of the nation in question will be lucky to have you on the job.</p></div><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous column’s question was from a couple frustrated with a grandchild’s lack of gratitude for their financial assistance and birthday presents.

Or she may equate their gifts with family control. Avoiding the grandparents might be a clumsy attempt to avoid a conflict she doesn’t know how to handle — or knows she can’t overcome. <em>—</em> <em>Karen</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>It is unwise to</strong> give a gift hoping to get something in return. We give equivalent gifts to each of our grandchildren because we want to. We are delighted when one grandson sends a handwritten thank-you note and let it pass when the others don’t. <em>—</em> <em>Pamela</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Perhaps there’s something else</strong> going on? Have the grandparents inadvertently expressed an opinion (for example about L.G.B.T.Q. issues or religious matters) that makes her afraid to get close to them? A nonthreatening conversation might help to clarify, if she’s willing to share at all. — <em>Linda</em></p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"19.5\"><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I agree wholeheartedly that</strong> conversations are the best way to address problems. The grandparents should approach their granddaughter but not bring up any financial concerns. She might benefit from hearing directly that they love her and know how now is a difficult time to be a teenager. Frankness, when done skillfully, is both ethical and polite. <em>—</em> <em>Russell</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I gravitate to what seems the bigger issue:</strong> Is the grandparents’ generosity a true gift — that is, a gift with no strings attached? Or is it really a “transactional” gift that requires some kind of reciprocity? If it’s a true gift, let it be so, and be grateful in the giving. If it really is a transaction, be upfront and let the family know there are expectations for the financial assistance. Be clear about the rules of engagement. If the grandparents expect something in return, I think it’s only fair that the granddaughter knows this. <em>—</em> <em>Vincent</em></p><hr><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

Fortunately, we have had the ability to be financially generous with our family and have established educational trusts for each of our grandchildren’s college tuition. All of our grandchildren have been appreciative, except for the youngest, who is 17 and a senior in high school. She never thanked us for funding her educational trust, and she has also neglected to thank us for the birthday gifts we have given her the past several years. At family get-togethers, she is openly effusive in greeting her aunts, uncle and cousins, but ignores us unless we approach her.</em></p><p><em>We’ve discussed this situation with our daughter (her mother) and have asked her if we’ve done something to antagonize this granddaughter. She tells us no, and that her daughter is just being a teenager. (Our other daughters agree with this assessment too.) We love our granddaughter and admire her accomplishments, but we are hurt by what appears to be her deliberate ignoring of our presence. My concern is not only with our feelings, but with her seeming failure to understand that her behavior is hurtful. I think that this kind of uncaring behavior from a high school senior is immature and mean spirited.</em></p><p><em>Our daughter discourages us from talking to our granddaughter about our frustration. We’ve considered withholding our annual donation to her college fund and limiting the value of her birthday gift, but we both agree that would be petty (and mean spirited as well). Can we discuss this with our granddaughter despite her mother’s admonition and recommendation to “leave it alone”? Do we wait until she’s 18 to discuss this adult to adult? </em>Names Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>There are a couple of distinct issues, as you recognize, in deciding whether or not to take up your granddaughter’s treatment of you directly with her. One is what to make of her behavior. Your daughter says she’s just being a teenager, but learning the consequences of one’s behavior — in this case, the bruised feelings of loving grandparents — can help teenagers mature. You have an independent relationship with this teenager; if you think your daughter’s recommendation is mistaken, you can tell her so and let her know you’re going to talk to your granddaughter about your concerns. She’s old enough to enlist in the military and old enough to understand how you feel; the fact that she is some months shy of becoming a legal adult makes no real difference.</p></div><p>It could be that your daughter has her reasons for wanting you to refrain. Usually, parents prod their children toward politeness: send your cousin that thank-you note, give your aunt a hug. Regardless of whether your granddaughter enjoys your company, she could easily be civil. Have you, unknowingly, offended the teenager in ways your daughter doesn’t want to bring up? If your daughter <em>has</em> tried to correct her, the effort obviously hasn’t been very successful. Is the child resisting her mother’s promptings? Or is your daughter’s real concern simply that you’ll mishandle the conversation?</p><p>Which brings us to the second question you raise. What will the effect be on your relationship with your granddaughter? Even if she senses she is not treating you properly, making this explicit could easily backfire: People often respond with resentment when the person they have wronged points out the wrongdoing. If there’s a conversation to be had, it shouldn’t be accusatory or aggrieved; you can ask if you’ve done anything to make her feel distant from you, while emphasizing how much you care about her.</p><p>Precisely because your financial generosity to your granddaughter is an expression of familial love, it shouldn’t be part of this discussion. The real problem with reducing your largess is that if she then mended her ways, you would all end up wondering whether you had effectively purchased her displays of affection. This could permanently damage your relationship with her. Authentic gratitude is what you’re entitled to, and it isn’t for sale.</p><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous newsletter’s question was from someone who wanted advice on how to nudge in-laws not to bring their dog with them when they visited: “Shouldn’t they just accept the fact that not everyone is comfortable with a pet and find ways to leave it at home (for a few hours) instead of taking it with them everywhere they go? … How can we delicately and politely let them know without hurting their feelings?”</em></p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.9811912225705326\" morss_score=\"28.39369122257053\"><p><em>In his response, the Ethicist encouraged candor: “Your in-laws can’t take your aversion into account if you don’t tell them about it. Your indirect hinting is clearly a dog whistle they’re unable to hear. Being truly courteous calls for being clear: You want to see them without their furry companion.

My dog Violet means a great deal to me. However, I’ve never had the audacity to drag them with me while visiting friends and family. It’s an uncomfortable situation for both pets and people. This couple has every right to expect that their loved ones ask each time if dogs are allowed before visiting, and they shouldn’t feel bad for doing so. <em>—</em> <em>Lisa</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I agree with the Ethicist, but</strong> I noticed that he did not talk about why it was the letter writer who has to communicate these boundaries, as opposed to her husband. She says she hates to bring it up to him. But it is his brother with whom the problem exists. Why wouldn’t they share the responsibility for this? <em>—</em> <em>Shari</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Dogs are like children</strong> to most dog owners. Unless the dog is aggressive or otherwise troublesome, I would suggest the hosts do their best to accommodate the pet just as they would a child. Yes, they’re not the same, but tell that to a dog owner. Is it really worth ostracizing someone over this just because your husband and children “aren’t incredibly fond of pets?” <em>—</em> <em>Kevin</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I’ve come to the conclusion</strong> that it’s never the pet that is the problem, but rather the owner. Some owners are in over their heads and others are simply oblivious to the (negative) impact their pets have on others. In this instance, the owners are oblivious. My experience with obliviousness is that it requires the proverbial sledgehammer to get the message across. Good luck talking nice. <em>—</em> <em>Todd</em></p></div><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I was so disappointed</strong> that this question was even included in The Ethicist column. I am hard-pressed to think of any situation that would ethically require someone to accept an animal that is not theirs into their home.

Since then, every time they have come over to our home, they have brought the dog too. My husband and children aren’t incredibly fond of pets. This creates some uncomfortable situations for us. I don’t think we truly enjoy their company, because they are always running around after the dog while they are with us. I have tried to indirectly hint that getting a dog sitter may be an option, but that’s hit or miss.</em></p><p><em>Nowadays we don’t feel that comfortable inviting them over as often. I feel sad, because it’s creating a distance between us. Shouldn’t they just accept the fact that not everyone is comfortable with a pet and find ways to leave it at home (for a few hours) instead of taking it with them everywhere they go? I hate bringing this up with my husband, because I know he is torn as well. How can we delicately and politely let them know without hurting their feelings? </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>I agree that visitors — including family members — should ask their hosts if they’re OK with pets being brought to their home. Still, pet lovers aren’t always aware that not everyone finds their furry friends as charming as they do (and that, either way, many have allergies to contend with). If you had spoken up at the start, this whole thing would have probably been a nonissue. Instead, the approach you chose — avoiding tension by staying silent — is now driving you all apart. It’s a shortsighted form of conflict avoidance that simply magnifies the conflict over time.</p><p>Your in-laws can’t take your aversion into account if you don’t tell them about it. Your indirect hinting is clearly a dog whistle they’re unable to hear. Being truly courteous calls for being clear: You want to see them without their furry companion. At this point, you may have to explain why you didn’t convey your concerns earlier, and you may not be able to avoid hurt feelings altogether. But affectionate candor would be an improvement over what you’re currently doing: rolling over while growling inaudibly.</p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"20.5\"><h2>A Bonus Question</h2><p><em>A while back, I tried to help a young man establish his own business so he could avoid having to work for others. He possesses an astounding amount of mechanical intelligence, and he is an excellent carpenter and all-around handyman. He also comes from a poor family.</em></p><p><em>I believed in his abilities, so I bought him supplies for his business and paid him generously for a project. I also got him some business referrals, but he didn’t follow up on them. He stopped responding to my texts, and when I saw him in person, he just walked away. I feel bad about this, but I feel worse for him because he doesn’t know how to treat someone who was good to him. I spent a lot of time, energy and money trying to help this man become an independent worker. Where do I go from here? </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>Let’s figure that this young man is aware that he has behaved badly toward a benefactor. It’s worth thinking about why.</p><p>Maybe he is embarrassed by having let you down. You set him up for jobs; for whatever reason, he couldn’t get it together to take advantage of what you did for him. Maybe some of your messages struck him as disrespectful (possibly those about his failure to follow up on your referrals). It’s hard to get the right tone in situations of mentorship. Or maybe — who knows? — a friend has persuaded him that your kindness was motivated by a sexual interest in him. Social scientists tell us that lower socioeconomic status corresponds with lower levels of generalized trust; precarity breeds vigilance. People who are on guard make themselves harder to hurt — but also harder to help.</p></div><p>If you want to try again to repair your relationship, you can propose meeting him for coffee and asking whether he thinks you’ve done something wrong and whether you can set it right. If there’s no response, then he has made his choice. An attitude of ingratitude is, alas, a common form of self-sabotage.</p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.97979797979798\" morss_score=\"22.906113769271663\"><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>Last week’s question was from an employer wondering when it was appropriate to fire their employee, whose father had just passed away.

It would seem to me that a young person who has worked for your company for 10 years would have advanced in his position had he been given proper guidance and encouragement. Usually productivity and allegiance toward a company happen when an employee feels valued. <em>—</em> <em>Emanuela</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>A bigger ethical dilemma</strong> than the recent death of the employee’s father may be the fact that he has worked at the company for 10 years. One certainly should not fire someone after 10 years without a tremendous amount of warning. I would be curious to know what specifically has changed over these years, and whether those changes have been articulated clearly to him. <em>—</em> <em>Jeanne</em></p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"25.0\"><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>While I agree with the Ethicist’s response</strong>, my 41 years as a union representative tells me that his assumption that the employer has tried to work with the man regarding his performance is likely unfounded. I have countless examples where the employer finds fault with performance and either doesn’t convey it or does so without helping the person improve with adequate support. <em>—</em> <em>Dorine</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>As a manager</strong>, if I have an employee with “poor reliability and work ethic,” that’s a serious failing — on my part. The letter writer doesn’t mention that they’ve done anything to fix this employee’s lacking behavior over his 10 years with the company. If an employee is going to be fired, he should fully expect it based on previous corrective actions and communication. <em>—</em> <em>Mick</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>A parent’s long illness</strong> and death is a devastating event. As a former hospital administrator, I say wait awhile and then speak to the employee and give him a few months to correct the problems. Two huge losses, parent and job, would be a lot for anyone to handle. I suggest compassion and a process, rather than an abrupt decision at this sensitive time. <em>—</em> <em>Marilyn</em></p><hr><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

I should also point out that with his off-the-charts intelligence and tremendous experience, it should be easy for him to find another job in our industry. </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>The central role of employment in a modern life means that people shouldn’t be fired without sufficient reason. As the philosopher Elizabeth Anderson has argued, a company has duties to its employees that derive from the fact that it exercises power over them, just as a state has duties to its citizens that derive from the fact that it exercises power over them. That is what’s wrong with the default legal assumption in almost all U.S. states that employment is “at will” and that, in the absence of a contract, we can be let go without any reason. (There are, to be sure, a medley of legally impermissible reasons for firing people — pregnancy, race, gender, religion, disability status, refusal to break the law, for example — though the details vary by state.)</p><p>Still, your central task, in supervising an employee, is to ensure that he is actually doing the job to the standard required. Your letter suggests that you have shown proper concern for him; in fact, you have done more than many companies would and, at least in some respects, more than you had a duty to do. I assume that you’ve told him clearly what you think is wrong with his performance and have allowed him an opportunity to improve. Giving him notice would then be acceptable; bad employees put a burden on good ones.

The parent wrote: “A few years ago, I began to take an interest in locating his birthparents. … He has [also] expressed some interest in locating his birth family, and he has a right to understand his origins. I have enough concern about privacy, however, that DNA ancestry is not something I would choose to do for myself. … What should I do?”</em></p><p><em>In his response, the Ethicist noted: “Your odds of success would seem to be extremely low in any case. The Nanchang Project, which aims to reconnect adoptees with their families in China, [only just] had its first successful match. … It’s true that there are effectively no restrictions on the Chinese government’s use of genetic data. But assuming that your son is planning to live outside China, you may not need to worry much. … Once you’ve got a firm sense of options, you can talk about them with your 8-year-old. Then it’s up to you whether to get out the swab.” (Reread the full question and answer </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/magazine/adopted-child-dna-biological-parents-ethics.html\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>As a Chinese adoptee,</strong> I strongly urge you to consider postponing this decision until your child is older. His feelings about his adoption experience will likely morph with time, and it should be up to him to determine how, when and to what extent he engages with his heritage. The best way you can support him is to let him lead. <em>—</em> <em>Sarah</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>The Ethicist’s response</strong> seemed to veer into the practicalities of testing more than the ethics of doing it. Unless there is evidence of immediate medical need, this is a decision that should be made by the child. The adoptive parent has no skin in this game — beyond curiosity — and it is an irreversible action. Genetic information cannot be retroactively withheld once divulged. <em>—</em> <em>David</em></p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"25.0\"><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Another benefit to</strong> testing your son could be to find a match for a sibling.

By searching now, it normalizes the conversation from a young age. <em>—</em> <em>Beverly</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>As both an adoptee and adoptive mother,</strong> I’ve found that gaining medical knowledge is a surefire contribution to quality of life. Money spent on a birth parent search via DNA would be better spent on having his DNA sequenced and checked for genetically linked diseases. None of us adoptees have real health records, nor do we know how our biological relatives died. Direct your money there. <em>—</em> <em>Janet</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>We adopted a daughter from</strong> South Korea over 23 years ago. Our feeling was that any desire to locate her birth parents needed to be driven by her, not our own interests.

The photos were of him at home, peaceful in bed; my mother wanted to tenderly remember him both in life and in his death. My partner at the time uploaded these photos to their computer, storing these and other images in their cloud server as we archived memories from the trip home to say goodbye to my father.</em></p><p><em>One evening later that year, my then-partner pulled up the photos and did a slide show of our trip for their family. When my partner got to the images of my father’s dead body, they went through every image instead of skipping over them. It was immensely painful, compounded by the fact that my father is a Black man and these images were being shown to an affluent white family. The race and class dynamics here were staggering — it felt as if this white family was viewing these images as entertainment. This was among the incidents that triggered my ending the relationship; my ex didn’t quite understand why this was inappropriate or painful.</em></p><p><em>As we were breaking up, I asked that they erase the images from their drive. Since that time, they’ve made a million excuses as to why they can’t erase the images — the drive is in storage, they’ve moved, etc. It’s now been nearly six years. Still, I am deeply disturbed by the lack of control I have over these images. Currently my ex lives in the U.K., and I live in the U.S. What is the correct course of action here? Do I let it go? Seek legal action? My great fear is that these images will circulate into the future without my or my family’s consent. </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>Your letter raises a number of issues, not least about your and your ex’s differing experiences of this slide show. Perhaps, in your judgment, this family wouldn’t have used the image of a white person of their class background in this way. If so, then this was indeed a case of the “racially based disregard for the welfare of certain people” that the philosopher Jorge L. A. Garcia once identified as “the heart of racism.”</p></div><p>Perhaps you feel that even if the family would have treated pictures of a deceased white person in the same manner, doing so would have been less unseemly because of the history of the abuse of images of Black suffering and death by white people (not least the lynching photographs that circulated around the turn of the 20th century). An awareness of that history may well have conditioned your response. Still, they were seeing these images in the context of a family member’s visit to the funeral of a partner. Details matter, and not knowing exactly how your ex’s family reacted to the pictures, I can’t say whether your appalled response was justified.</p><p>What’s incontestable is that you’ve been greatly pained by what happened. Whether or not your ex understood your reaction, they should have complied with your request. Your ex doesn’t own these images and isn’t entitled to circulate them without permission. Indeed, the person who took the photographs could formally register the copyright, and a lawyer’s letter could be sent giving formal notice that the copyright holder asks that these images not be reproduced or publicly circulated. That would at least further underline the seriousness with which you regard the issue.</p><p>Given that these images don’t seem to have been further circulated, though, it’s unclear what grounds you’d have for pursuing legal action. How would you even establish their continued existence? Which brings us to a curious feature of your situation. At any point, your ex could simply have claimed to have deleted them; you had no way to verify this claim. Yet you’ve been denied this assurance, real or spurious. You’re not being told no; you’re being told “not yet.” The natural inference is that your ex wants to maintain a status quo in which you’re regularly in touch.</p><p>Letting go of this issue — if you can manage it, psychologically — means letting go of your ex. That’s the main reason I’d urge you to try. Six years after your breakup, your demands, however legitimate, are keeping you in each other’s lives. That outcome may suit your ex. I don’t think it suits you.</p><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous column’s question was from a woman whose neighbors regularly left their young child outside, sometimes in foul weather, screaming and crying.

But so much of child rearing takes place in private that it’s hard to be sanguine about this.</p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"20.5\"><p>Calling social services isn’t something to be done lightly, but if what you describe is indeed occurring regularly, a child is being seriously mistreated. Even if the social-services experts look into the matter and decide not to do anything, the family might gain some instruction, and you will have done your duty.</p><h2>A Bonus Question</h2><p><em>I have been asked by a major economic-development institution to participate in a mission to improve the labor-market information in an undemocratic country with a poor human rights record. I believe that a better-functioning labor market will be beneficial for the country’s citizens and perhaps help hasten democracy there. I cannot be sure, however, that the data that I would recommend them to collect would only be used for the public good and be immune from manipulation. I would certainly strongly advise the use of measures to protect survey respondents and ensure that they can respond accurately. But the country lacks the democratic institutions that would enforce these protections. What’s more, improvements for the populace could strengthen the current regime’s power, instead of hastening democracy.</em></p><p><em>Should I refuse to participate in this project, or do I participate and do what I can to help the lives of the people living in this country? </em>— Name Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>The project is going ahead with or without you, and your participation could mitigate some of its possible downsides. So, from a consequentialist perspective, participating is the better choice. Consequences aren’t all that matters, to be sure. It’s perfectly reasonable to decide that you’re not the kind of person who would participate in a vile project, even if your participation would make the outcome slightly better. (The philosopher Bernard Williams, in an influential discussion of integrity, posed the example of a chemist who was reluctant to take a job involved with chemical and biological weapons, even if he, unlike an alternate candidate, might be able to slow down the weapons program a bit.) I don’t see this as being an issue here, however. The project may lead to some bad effects, but it’s being done with good intentions. It sounds as if the development institution and the people of the nation in question will be lucky to have you on the job.</p></div><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous column’s question was from a couple frustrated with a grandchild’s lack of gratitude for their financial assistance and birthday presents.

Avoiding the grandparents might be a clumsy attempt to avoid a conflict she doesn’t know how to handle — or knows she can’t overcome. <em>—</em> <em>Karen</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>It is unwise to</strong> give a gift hoping to get something in return. We give equivalent gifts to each of our grandchildren because we want to. We are delighted when one grandson sends a handwritten thank-you note and let it pass when the others don’t. <em>—</em> <em>Pamela</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Perhaps there’s something else</strong> going on? Have the grandparents inadvertently expressed an opinion (for example about L.G.B.T.Q. issues or religious matters) that makes her afraid to get close to them? A nonthreatening conversation might help to clarify, if she’s willing to share at all. — <em>Linda</em></p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"19.5\"><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I agree wholeheartedly that</strong> conversations are the best way to address problems. The grandparents should approach their granddaughter but not bring up any financial concerns. She might benefit from hearing directly that they love her and know how now is a difficult time to be a teenager. Frankness, when done skillfully, is both ethical and polite. <em>—</em> <em>Russell</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I gravitate to what seems the bigger issue:</strong> Is the grandparents’ generosity a true gift — that is, a gift with no strings attached? Or is it really a “transactional” gift that requires some kind of reciprocity? If it’s a true gift, let it be so, and be grateful in the giving. If it really is a transaction, be upfront and let the family know there are expectations for the financial assistance. Be clear about the rules of engagement. If the grandparents expect something in return, I think it’s only fair that the granddaughter knows this. <em>—</em> <em>Vincent</em></p><hr><p>Kwame Anthony Appiah teaches philosophy at N.Y.U.

Fortunately, we have had the ability to be financially generous with our family and have established educational trusts for each of our grandchildren’s college tuition. All of our grandchildren have been appreciative, except for the youngest, who is 17 and a senior in high school. She never thanked us for funding her educational trust, and she has also neglected to thank us for the birthday gifts we have given her the past several years. At family get-togethers, she is openly effusive in greeting her aunts, uncle and cousins, but ignores us unless we approach her.</em></p><p><em>We’ve discussed this situation with our daughter (her mother) and have asked her if we’ve done something to antagonize this granddaughter. She tells us no, and that her daughter is just being a teenager. (Our other daughters agree with this assessment too.) We love our granddaughter and admire her accomplishments, but we are hurt by what appears to be her deliberate ignoring of our presence. My concern is not only with our feelings, but with her seeming failure to understand that her behavior is hurtful. I think that this kind of uncaring behavior from a high school senior is immature and mean spirited.</em></p><p><em>Our daughter discourages us from talking to our granddaughter about our frustration. We’ve considered withholding our annual donation to her college fund and limiting the value of her birthday gift, but we both agree that would be petty (and mean spirited as well). Can we discuss this with our granddaughter despite her mother’s admonition and recommendation to “leave it alone”? Do we wait until she’s 18 to discuss this adult to adult? </em>Names Withheld</p><p><strong>From the Ethicist:</strong></p><p>There are a couple of distinct issues, as you recognize, in deciding whether or not to take up your granddaughter’s treatment of you directly with her. One is what to make of her behavior. Your daughter says she’s just being a teenager, but learning the consequences of one’s behavior — in this case, the bruised feelings of loving grandparents — can help teenagers mature. You have an independent relationship with this teenager; if you think your daughter’s recommendation is mistaken, you can tell her so and let her know you’re going to talk to your granddaughter about your concerns. She’s old enough to enlist in the military and old enough to understand how you feel; the fact that she is some months shy of becoming a legal adult makes no real difference.</p></div><p>It could be that your daughter has her reasons for wanting you to refrain. Usually, parents prod their children toward politeness: send your cousin that thank-you note, give your aunt a hug. Regardless of whether your granddaughter enjoys your company, she could easily be civil. Have you, unknowingly, offended the teenager in ways your daughter doesn’t want to bring up? If your daughter <em>has</em> tried to correct her, the effort obviously hasn’t been very successful. Is the child resisting her mother’s promptings? Or is your daughter’s real concern simply that you’ll mishandle the conversation?</p><p>Which brings us to the second question you raise. What will the effect be on your relationship with your granddaughter? Even if she senses she is not treating you properly, making this explicit could easily backfire: People often respond with resentment when the person they have wronged points out the wrongdoing. If there’s a conversation to be had, it shouldn’t be accusatory or aggrieved; you can ask if you’ve done anything to make her feel distant from you, while emphasizing how much you care about her.</p><p>Precisely because your financial generosity to your granddaughter is an expression of familial love, it shouldn’t be part of this discussion. The real problem with reducing your largess is that if she then mended her ways, you would all end up wondering whether you had effectively purchased her displays of affection. This could permanently damage your relationship with her. Authentic gratitude is what you’re entitled to, and it isn’t for sale.</p><h2>Readers Respond</h2><p><em>The previous newsletter’s question was from someone who wanted advice on how to nudge in-laws not to bring their dog with them when they visited: “Shouldn’t they just accept the fact that not everyone is comfortable with a pet and find ways to leave it at home (for a few hours) instead of taking it with them everywhere they go? … How can we delicately and politely let them know without hurting their feelings?”</em></p><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"2.9811912225705326\" morss_score=\"28.39369122257053\"><p><em>In his response, the Ethicist encouraged candor: “Your in-laws can’t take your aversion into account if you don’t tell them about it.

She says she hates to bring it up to him. But it is his brother with whom the problem exists. Why wouldn’t they share the responsibility for this? <em>—</em> <em>Shari</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Dogs are like children</strong> to most dog owners. Unless the dog is aggressive or otherwise troublesome, I would suggest the hosts do their best to accommodate the pet just as they would a child.

Is it really worth ostracizing someone over this just because your husband and children “aren’t incredibly fond of pets?” <em>—</em> <em>Kevin</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I’ve come to the conclusion</strong> that it’s never the pet that is the problem, but rather the owner. Some owners are in over their heads and others are simply oblivious to the (negative) impact their pets have on others. In this instance, the owners are oblivious. My experience with obliviousness is that it requires the proverbial sledgehammer to get the message across. Good luck talking nice. <em>—</em> <em>Todd</em></p></div><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>I was so disappointed</strong> that this question was even included in The Ethicist column. I am hard-pressed to think of any situation that would ethically require someone to accept an animal that is not theirs into their home.

As the philosopher Elizabeth Anderson has argued, a company has duties to its employees that derive from the fact that it exercises power over them, just as a state has duties to its citizens that derive from the fact that it exercises power over them. That is what’s wrong with the default legal assumption in almost all U.S. states that employment is “at will” and that, in the absence of a contract, we can be let go without any reason.

Then it’s up to you whether to get out the swab.” (Reread the full question and answer </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/magazine/adopted-child-dna-biological-parents-ethics.html\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.)</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>As a Chinese adoptee,</strong> I strongly urge you to consider postponing this decision until your child is older. His feelings about his adoption experience will likely morph with time, and it should be up to him to determine how, when and to what extent he engages with his heritage. The best way you can support him is to let him lead. <em>—</em> <em>Sarah</em></p><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>The Ethicist’s response</strong> seemed to veer into the practicalities of testing more than the ethics of doing it. Unless there is evidence of immediate medical need, this is a decision that should be made by the child. The adoptive parent has no skin in this game — beyond curiosity — and it is an irreversible action. Genetic information cannot be retroactively withheld once divulged. <em>—</em> <em>David</em></p></div><div class=\"css-53u6y8\" morss_own_score=\"3.0\" morss_score=\"25.0\"><p><strong>⬥</strong></p><p><strong>Another benefit to</strong> testing your son could be to find a match for a sibling.

Apatanis principally use three rice varieties: Emeo, Pyape and Mypia.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/vale-of-apatanis-56032\">Vale of Apatanis</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The total area of the Apatani Plateau is 10,135 square kilometres, where rice-fish culture is undertaken approximately in 592.0 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice lands out of 715.7 ha.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau is a land of diverse cultures. The major festivals of Apatanis are the Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung. People here believe that these traditional festivals ensure better productivity and well-being.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from humid subtropical to temperate. So, this plateau receives adequate rainfall during the summer season. The permeability and water-retaining capacity of the clayey, loamy soil favour this unique farming technique.</p>\n<p>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a low-input and eco-friendly practice. The stocked fish practically depend on the natural food sources of the rice fields and thus, farmers hardly need to use any supplementary fish feeds.</p>\n<p>The farmers sometimes use household and agricultural wastes and excreta of domestic animals like pigs, cows, mithun (<em>Bos frontalis</em>) and goats to make farming more sustainable and organic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, azolla and lemna are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers. The organic food grown in the field plays an essential role in feeding fish.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/recognise-empower-indigenous-land-tenure-and-title-to-achieve-sdgs-holistically-un-report-75997\">Recognise, empower indigenous land tenure and title to achieve SDGs holistically: UN Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The water sources in these high-altitude rice fields are mountain streams and rainwater trickled down during the monsoon season.</p>\n<p>Bamboo pipes are being used to distribute water from the networks of earthen irrigation channels using two outlet pipes. An outlet is fitted angularly at the upper level through a dyke to maintain the water level and another outlet is fitted at the bottom of the dyke to the exterior. It is used for dewatering the field during harvest.</p>\n<p>Men and women perform different farm duties while preparing the fields for cultivating rice. And during the culture of fish, women folk participate as the major workforce.</p>\n<p>Ancient and old-fashioned agricultural technologies are utilised for cultivation. Modern tools like tractors and power tillers are not affordable as well as inaccessible to the farmers.</p>\n<p>They mostly use agricultural tools such as <em>Dao</em> (sickle) and dibbling sticks. After preparing the field, they transplant a maximum of two-three healthy rice plants with an average distance of 26 cm from each other.</p>\n<p><span>Fish refuges are also created inside the fields. Three strains of fish species of common carp — </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiospecularis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpio communis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpionudus — </span></em><span>are stocked just after ten days from transplanting rice.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492\">Sustainable rice production key to food security</a></span></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The stocked fish are harvested twice in a season. The first and second or final harvest is done in the middle of July and October, respectively. But the rice is harvested at the end of September until the mid of October, i.e. once in a season.</span></p>\n<p><span>Four cultivars of rice are grown along with fish species of </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiol</span></em><span>. The total productivity ranges from 300-500 kilograms of fish per hectare in one season (ha-1 season-1) and 3,000-4,000 kg of rice (ha-1 season-1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish enhances rice productivity (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the mineralisation of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances rice yield here. The records of rice and fish yields were obtained from the farmers through personal interviews.</span></p>\n<p>Dykes at a higher elevation and lower elevation are constructed with a height of 0.9 m to 1.5 m and 0.4 to 0.6 m. These dykes are also used to remove water from the field during harvesting. Bamboo fencing is done to avoid the escape of fish through the pipes.</p>\n<p>This eco-friendly and economically beneficial practice has made the system unique in terms of aquatic resource utilisation.</p>\n<p>The zooplankton and algal life forms serve as natural food sources for the fish in the flooded rice fields to enhance aquatic productivity. This ecosystem service, in turn, indirectly maintains healthy human-made swamps with better livelihood options for tribal framers.</p>\n<p>Field water depth is the limiting factor. All the agro-inputs in this ecosystem with organic manures, decomposed rice stubbles and macrophytes, along with other biotic and abiotic factors, regulate their various population properties in the inundated rice fields.</p>\n<p>For growth and development, the stocked fish in the rice field may have utilised and assimilated available aquatic biomass and zooplankton through trophic interactions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, high-altitude flooded environments enriched with such natural fish feeds have sufficient scope to raise fish as a concurrent crop of rice in the same field.</p>\n<p>In the context of plankton and other fish food organisms, the wet rice fields are still data deficient. The water quality parameters, community structure and population dynamics of algal life forms under the rice canopy are favourable for the growth and abundance of zooplankton, which greatly influences the fish yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such unique integrated farming systems require special attention for better productivity and profitability to the small-scale rural farmers in Assam and other northeastern hill states.</p>\n<h3>Read more:</h3>\n<p><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of</em> Down To Earth</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

A farmer can be termed as the first person to be impacted by climate change since s/he is in a livelihood that directly depends on climate.</p>\n<p>This affects the country’s overall agricultural output and also adds to food inflation. High food prices could result in people slashing down consumption as well. This, on the other hand, impacts negatively on nutritional security.</p>\n<p>Among farming households, a significant number produce food for their own consumption. These households gave birth to the old saying that those who eat their own food are also the healthiest ones.</p>\n<p>For countries like India where malnutrition is high and food insecurity is a nagging constant, such households have used the home production system to remain out of it.</p>\n<p>As many studies point out, these households are also protected from market fluctuations thus ensuring their affordability for healthy food. Obviously, they are not impacted by food inflation as well.</p>\n<p>But serious conversations are taking place over how climate change-induced extreme weather events would impact such households. To begin with, we need to know the linkage between nutrition intake and household food production; and whether weather fluctuation would have any impact on this.</p>\n<p>A recent research paper from the <a href=\"https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136557/filename/136768.pdf\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) attempts to answer the first question: How much do weather conditions impact a home food production system?</p>\n<p>Researchers Hiroyuki Takeshima, Sunil Saroj and Anjani Kumar have analysed village-level data from households on their own food production and consumption and correlated the local weather situations to infer whether there was a significant relationship.</p>\n<p>The IFPRI paper first established that people growing their own food consume more, thus adding to nutrition level and also attaining overall food security. “On average, growing grain crops at home led to Rs 12.184 higher average grain consumption per month per household,” found the research paper.</p>\n<p>This trend is not limited only to grains. Consumption increases significantly for pulses, dairy, vegetables and fruits, if grown at home. The research could establish a link between increased consumption and reduction in child stunting, underweight and women achieving normal body-mass-index. These trends are more pronounced in remote villages.</p>\n<p>But these ‘positive effects’ of growing your own food are observed to be ‘significantly magnified’ if the weather is closer to normal. This is the most definitive linkage of climate and food intake established by this research paper among the food-growing households.</p>\n<p>If the rainfall is one standard deviation closer to the normal figure, grain consumption increases by Rs 12.282. Similarly, if the temperature is one standard deviation from normal, consumption increases by Rs 5.723. This also means that normal weather will increase all other physical benefits.</p>\n<p>This implies that if these households experience adverse weather conditions, their overall food and nutritional security would be negatively impacted. Also, without normal weather, they may have to depend more on markets thus spending more on food than before. This would have an impact on overall economic well being.</p>\n<p>This makes the case for climate-proofing these food producers who till now remain untouched from the crisis. Moreover, these are the people who are yet to be impacted by the market-driven agriculture system. While climate change takes all under its grips, this system of food production needs a prudent reaction.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

Instead, I argue that if we accept McMahan’s position, then logically, we must accept that a being’s <em>moral character</em> is a morally relevant property which we ought to consider when determining their moral status. As I will explain, this therefore means that moral status is not static; it is fluid. Further to this, in the latter stages of this paper, I consider that if we do accept that moral status is action dependant, then there might be <em>negative</em> moral status. On the topic of negative moral status, I do not aim to give any in-depth arguments either for or against its existence, but rather just flag this as a potential avenue for further exploration if we do indeed follow McMahan’s theories of intuitionism and moral individualism.</p>\n<p>I argue that by accepting that being’s actions affects its moral status, this resolves intuitional conflict felt when we consider so-called marginal cases (i.e., any being that is typically thought to sit on the edge of a moral status threshold).<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftn2\">[2]</a></p>\n<p>For the sake of clarity in this paper I take moral status to mean the following: If a being has moral status, then we have obligations to treat it in certain ways for its <em>own</em> sake. This is contrasting what I label ‘relational status’, in which means the following: If a being has relational status, then we have obligations to treat it in certain ways for the sake of some <em>other</em> being (which has moral status).<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftn3\">[3]</a>  In this paper I exclusively consider the <em>moral status </em>of beings. This moral status is attributed to the possession of morally relevant intrinsic properties or characteristics possessed by a being, and often includes properties such as: Possession of consciousness; ability to suffer; ability to use complex language or communicate; ability to be altruistic; possession of rationality.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftn4\">[4]</a></p>\n<p>I begin by outlining the view that moral status is action dependent if we follow McMahan’s position:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Moral Status and Actions:</u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>McMahan’s position is that there is no singular morally relevant intrinsic property which is not <em>solely</em> possessed by human beings, nor is it possessed by <em>all </em>human beings. This means the egalitarian position — that all human beings are of an equal and same level of moral status —  cannot hold to be true. Instead moral status is seen to be attributed as a result of an individual being’s possession of (some, or all) of these morally relevant intrinsic properties.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftn5\">[5]</a> We can test this intuition through the use of a thought experiment:</p>\n<p>There is a burning building, and trapped inside of this building in two separate rooms (equidistant) from the only entry and exit point are two beings. There is no personal risk to entering the building, and which ever being is not saved has no other means of escape.</p>\n<p><u>Case 1: </u></p>\n<p>In room 1: A statistically normal human being</p>\n<p>In room 2: A statistically normal dog</p>\n<p><em>Which being do you save?</em></p>\n<p>Our intuitions in this case (1) show that we ought to save the human being in room 1. Why? Because (to phrase it in the same way as McMahan) the human being in room 1 possesses more morally relevant intrinsic properties, and greater time-relative interests and so will suffer greater harm than the dog.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftn6\">[6]</a></p>\n<p><u>Case 2: </u></p>\n<p>In room 1: A statistically normal human being</p>\n<p>In room 2: A severely cognitively disabled human being</p>\n<p>Here, the intuitions become less clear. If we follow McMahan’s intuitionism — and if we exclude any relational value held by either human being — the severely cognitively disabled human being in room 2 possesses fewer morally relevant intrinsic properties than the human being in room 1. However, this leaves one with a sense of uncomfortableness. Consider the following case also:</p>\n<p><u>Case 3: </u></p>\n<p>In room 1: A statistically normal human being <em>who has committed only good acts, and is a morally good person. </em></p>\n<p>In room 2: A statistically normal human being<em> who has committed morally repugnant acts, and is a morally bad person. </em></p>\n<p>Here, our intuitions are less uncomfortable. It seems clear that we ought to save the morally good human being in room 1, over the morally bad human being in room 2. In fact, this is a case that McMahan himself considered:</p>\n<p>‘When I ask my students about these cases, they are unanimous in thinking that one ought morally to save the virtuous person and, in the second choice, kill the murderer’. (McMahan, 2007: 102).</p>\n<p>The unanimity of the students shows that this intuition – that morally good persons are of a higher value  — holds. By McMahan’s own subscription to the reflective equilibrium methodology then, this ought to lead us to revise our belief that moral status is based <em>solely </em>upon the intrinsic properties that a being possesses, and accept that our actions do matter. Instead, he makes the following comment: “All this leaves me profoundly uncomfortable.” (McMahan, 2007: 104).</p>\n<p>It does, however, seem clear that this intuitional discomfort can be explored further, consider:</p>\n<p><u>Case 4: </u></p>\n<p>Room 1: A severely cognitively disabled human being</p>\n<p>Room 2: A statistically normal human being, <em>who has committed many morally repugnant acts, and is – without a doubt – a morally bad person. </em></p>\n<p>Here we are comparing the value of a severely cognitively disabled human being and a morally abhorrent (but otherwise cognitively normal) human being. In this case the intuitional discomfort is not as present. It seems that we would, <em>ceteris</em> <em>paribus</em>, save the human being in room 1, over the thoroughly morally bad person. This does therefore show (using McMahan’s theoretical framework) that moral status is — in part — <em>action dependent</em>. This therefore raises the following question: If moral status is action dependent, then is it also fluid? (I.e. can it change up or down?) This will be explored in the following section.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Fluid Moral Status: </u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the beginning of this paper I stated that I would argue that moral status is fluid, and is not static as it is currently thought to be. This point requires additional clarification, as I note that there is a possible objection to my statement here: This being that moral status is not argued to be strictly static by moral individualists. In the view held by McMahan it is accepted that if a being’s morally relevant intrinsic properties change, then so can their moral status. This means that if I — a conscious, rational being, capable of suffering — am involved in a tragic accident in which I suffer irreparable brain damage, to the point my ability to be rational or conscious or to suffer is lost <em>completely</em>, then my moral status would be lowered. This, I accept.</p>\n<p>However, as I will now go on to explain, if moral status is considered to be (at least in part) action dependant, then no such tragic accident will need to occur in order to change a being’s moral status. Instead it will change <em>fluidly</em> based upon the individual actions a moral agent commits. As case 4 demonstrates, our intuitions show that a morally relevant difference is the moral character of those human beings. If a being has chosen to commit morally bad acts, then intuitionally we see them to be of lesser moral importance. In short: Our actions affect our moral status. This amendment to McMahan’s position solves the intuitional conflict we face when considering marginal cases.</p>\n<p>We can express this view as the following principle:</p>\n<p>Moral Modification Principle (MMP) – A being’s moral status can go up and down depending on their deliberate choice of actions (i.e. whether they commit good or bad acts).</p>\n<p>As we believe a non-moral agent cannot be held accountable for their actions, then this naturally <em>excludes</em> the marginal cases I discussed earlier: The severely cognitively disabled, infant children and non-human animals would all be excluded from the MMP. After all, we do not blame a cat for killing a mouse according to her <em>instincts</em>, nor do we punish an infant child who <em>without knowing any better </em>inflicts deliberate harm on another. As such the MMP would <em>only</em> apply to moral agents, such as you and I.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftn7\">[7]</a></p>\n<p>Fluid moral status does raise an additional consideration: If moral status is fluid, and can go down based upon the morally bad actions a being commits, can a being have a negative moral status? I will consider this briefly in the following section.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Negative Moral Status:</u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I do not have room to explore the view of a negative moral status in depth. It is, however, important to consider this. As moral status is seen to be discussed as an entirely positive matter (i.e., if a cat has moral status then we have obligations towards the cat which protects her rights and limits her suffering), the view of a negative moral status would has (as far as I can discern) not been considered.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftn8\">[8]</a></p>\n<p>Above I have argued the line of intuitionism used by McMahan allows for the intuition that moral status is action dependent. If the moral status of a moral agent can reduce based upon the morally bad actions they commit, then it stands to reason that (potentially) the moral agent can commit so many bad acts that they reduce themselves to a <em>negative moral status value</em>. Exactly what these acts would have to be are beyond me, and it is not my argument that there be a considerable number of moral agents which would ever fall below this threshold. But let us presume that such a morally bad being exists and they have reduced their moral status to a negative degree, what would this mean?</p>\n<p>Well, reasonably we can assume that our positive obligations towards this being would cease to exist. We would not be obliged to protect them from harm, to protect their freedoms and rights, or to treat them in ways which avoid their unnecessary suffering. Additionally we must ask that, if we have a negative duty towards them, would we ever have a duty to harm them? On this, I give one final case:</p>\n<p><u>Case 5: </u></p>\n<p>Room 1: A thoroughly morally reprehensible being, who has willingly committed numerous morally abhorrent acts.</p>\n<p>Room 2: An empty room. There is nothing else to save.</p>\n<p>In this case (5) we have the choice to either save one (morally bad) being or to not save anything at all. In such a case — where a being has lowered their moral status substantially (so much so that it is negative) —  then do we have any obligation to save them even when we have nothing else to prevent us from doing so? May we allow them suffer, to inflict a non-direct harm on them because of this moral status level? Here I cannot give answers. However, I am struck that it leaves me with the same “profound uncomfortableness” felt by McMahan. Perhaps we should abandon the framework altogether if this where our intuitions leave us.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><u>Conclusion: </u></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have argued that if we are to fully develop McMahan’s theory, then we ought to accept moral status is action dependent. I have argued this solves the intuitional conflict we face when comparing the moral status held by rational agents and marginal cases. I argued then that if moral status is action dependent, then it is also fluid.</p>\n<p>Following this, I introduced the possibility of negative moral status. This, I have briefly discussed, is an implication of action dependent moral status. As such, it seems plausible that if a moral agent commits numerous moral atrocities then perhaps we have negative obligations towards them. So, we ought to abandon our positive obligations of protection towards them that moral status ordinarily affords. Again, here, I postulate that if this theory of negative moral status violates our intuitions and we cannot revise it using the reflective equilibrium model of intuitionism, then perhaps we ought to abandon the framework altogether – but if we do not, and then the profound uncomfortableness felt by McMahan is unjustified.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> For McMahan’s work on intuitionism, see: (2013), and for his work on moral individualism see: (2002).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> E.g., some non-human animals, the severely cognitively disabled, and infant children.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> For greater discussion on the distinction between moral status and relational status, see: DeGrazia (2008)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftnref4\">[4]</a> An extensive discussion of these morally relevant properties is had by Rachels in his (1999) book <em>Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism</em>. This is of particular interest as McMahan cites the work of Rachels in his own work, and argues for the same (albeit weaker) position of moral individualism.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftnref5\">[5]</a> I will not discuss in detail egalitarian accounts, due to space constraints. However, for more on this see: Waldron (2008), Scanlon (2000), and Dworkin (1981). While all vary slightly on what they ground the notion of human equality in, they share the characteristic of advocating for the same and equal moral status of all human beings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftnref6\">[6]</a> By “greater time-relative interests” I mean the human being can plan for the future, fear about it’s well being of its future self.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftnref7\">[7]</a> I am aware that there is more to be said on the cases that are excluded from the MMP, as I believe there is a strong argument that psychopaths and the mentally insane ought to excluded also (as they are, arguably, non-moral agents also). Additionally I accept that if we alter a non-human animal to possess the ability to be a normal agent that the cat, in the above case, <em>would </em>be subject to the MMP.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/#_ftnref8\">[8]</a> More so, the view held by many is that moral status is a “all or nothing” situation. So, you either have moral status, or you do not (see: Kant (2017)  for an account on this). Additionally moral status has been argued to come in degrees (see: DeGrazia, 2008), but this is the view that moral status degrees come at varying points between nothing and full moral status – without a consideration of a negative moral status.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk%2F2023%2F03%2Fwhy-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status%2F&amp;t=Why%20Actions%20Matter%3A%20The%20Case%20for%20Fluid%20Moral%20Status\"><img src=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/plugins/sociable-30/pro/images/komodo/32/facebook.png\" title=\"Facebook\"></a></li><li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20Actions%20Matter%3A%20The%20Case%20for%20Fluid%20Moral%20Status%20-%20http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/why-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status/\"><img src=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/plugins/sociable-30/pro/images/komodo/32/twitter.png\" title=\"Twitter\"></a></li><li><a href=\"http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk%2F2023%2F03%2Fwhy-actions-matter-the-case-for-fluid-moral-status%2F&amp;title=Why%20Actions%20Matter%3A%20The%20Case%20for%20Fluid%20Moral%20Status\"><img src=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/plugins/sociable-30/pro/images/komodo/32/reddit.png\" title=\"Reddit\"></a></li></ul>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n",

One such question is “what news media should we consume?”. Alex Worsnip suggests that we have an obligation to consume media from across the political landscape. This essay argues against this claim by showing that any obligation to diversify our media consumption in this way would face severe limitations. §2 will consider Worsnip’s argument. §3 will show why we are under no general obligation to diversify our media consumption. Finally, in §4 I consider and respond to potential responses to my position.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Worsnip’s Argument </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Worsnip claims that we are obliged to diversify the news media we consume such that we should read sources from across the political landscape, including those belonging to political positions that we disagree with<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/do-we-have-an-obligation-to-diversify-our-media-consumption/#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.  Before looking at how Worsnip structures and justifies his argument, I want to clarify the strength of his claim. There is a distinction between an obligation and a mere reason; Worsnip posits that we are under the former. I have a reason to attend office hours for my classes, it would improve my learning, but if I fail to do so I am not necessarily open to criticism. Perhaps I have a class scheduled at the same time; this would be a stronger reason to not attend office hours. However, if I fail to follow through on an obligation (say, the obligation not to kill) it seems that you automatically have licence to criticise me.</p>\n<p>Obligations are not totally general, I might rightly kill an unprovoked attacker to save my own life. Such instances indicate the limit of an obligation. If an obligation can be shown to be so limited that we can freely break it in a wide range of cases, then talk of an obligation becomes less natural. Instead, it starts to look more like we just have a reason to act. I suggest that Worsnip’s obligation is better thought of as a <em>reason</em> to diversify our media consumption; one that will often be defeated.</p>\n<p>Now, let us consider why Worsnip thinks we are obliged to diversify our media consumption. He claims that all publications, regardless of partisan affiliation, are illicitly influenced to a non-trivial degree. Illicit influences are those that lead a publication to report in a non-ideal way, leaving out important details or presenting the details in a way that is misleading, etc.</p>\n<p>Worsnip considers two relevant ways that illicit influence might affect reporting. The first is through belief formation. Suppose a reporter believes that NATO should arm Ukraine. An uncomfortable consequence of arming the Ukrainian military is that some civilians will inevitably be killed by the donated arms. The desire to avoid acknowledging this tragic outcome might lead the reporter to wilfully ignore or discredit evidence that shows civilian deaths occurring because of these weapons. If they erroneously discredit the evidence or underreport the deaths, they do so under illicit influence.</p>\n<p>The second illicit influence more directly acts on the decision-making process regarding what facts to report. Consider the Ukraine example again, but this time the reporter actively believes that the donated weapons are killing civilians. However, because they still support NATO’s involvement, they do not want to do anything that will lead to public pressure against the intervention. This desire leads them not to report credible evidence of the deaths. Again, illicit influence is at play.</p>\n<p>Having defined illicit influence, Worsnip’s argument is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We should expect all publications to be illicitly influenced to a non-trivial degree.</li>\n<li>Illicitly influenced publications are prone to omit important facts and stories.</li>\n<li>Reading only news sources from anyone side of the political spectrum will result in an incomplete picture of the evidence (From 1,2).</li>\n<li>We cannot rely on ourselves to adjust our beliefs to correct for the incompleteness of our evidence.</li>\n<li>Reading only news sources from any one side of the political spectrum will result in epistemically non-ideal beliefs (From 3,4).</li>\n<li>We are obliged to avoid having epistemically non-ideal beliefs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Conclusion: We have an obligation to diversify our sources to be from across the political spectrum (From 5,6).</p>\n<p>(1) is plausible; given the presumption that all publications have a political leaning, it seems that any given publication is going to have illicit, politically biased influences. We could dig into the differing degrees of influence, but I will grant Worsnip this claim for the purposes of this essay. (2) is a straightforward consequence of illicit influence.</p>\n<p>(4) seems an uncontentious claim about our psychology but it does highlight an important aspect of Worsnip’s theory, it is non-ideal. The distinction between ideal and non-ideal epistemic theories is in the agents that they apply to. Ideal epistemic theories consider ideal agents. Perhaps ideal agents would be able to adjust their beliefs appropriately once they recognise that their data set was incomplete, Worsnip’s argument would not apply to them. Non-ideal theories try to determine what course of action to recommend to non-ideal agents considering their failings. That Worsnip is acting in the non-ideal theory space will be relevant when we come to the objection and rebuttal. (6) is the premise which I will be indirectly contesting in the rest of this essay: in many cases, we are not obliged to diversify our sources. Given this creates a contradiction with the argument as stated, I suggest that (6) is misguided. Instead, we generally have a <em>defeasible</em> <em>reason</em> to avoid epistemically non-ideal beliefs by diversifying our media sources. With this in mind we can now turn to the objection.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Counter Case – Positive Social Movements </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The claim is this; in many cases, we do something wrong when we follow Worsnip’s advice. We could not be obliged to do something that is often wrong so I conclude that we are not under a general obligation to diversify our media consumption. I want to examine a case where many people are going to be obliged to not diversify their sources on partisan lines. I will use Black Lives Matter (BLM) as an instance of a positive social movement, however the argument will generalise to any positive social movement that the reader prefers.</p>\n<p>We start with the premise that social movements such as BLM can be undermined by publications reporting only true claims. Banks’s 2018 work more fully explores the use of racial grammar, public memory, and framing in delegitimising BLM<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/do-we-have-an-obligation-to-diversify-our-media-consumption/#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. Here, I want to focus on framing. In April 2015 Baltimore police killed Freddie Gray, a black man, while he was in their custody. This resulted in a largely peaceful protest, during which a small number of protestors rioted. Media coverage focussed heavily on the protest’s violent aspects, highlighting photos of the rioters over the peaceful protestors and keeping the debate focussed on the appropriateness of the rioting, rather than the virtues and necessity of BLM.</p>\n<p>By focussing on these factors, publications make salient certain facts that can erroneously undermine our faith in legitimate social movements. Framing BLM in such a way as to link it with violent protest can delegitimise it when non-ideal agents are unable to adjust their beliefs appropriately in light of this framing. Given the politically charged nature of BLM, we can expect partisan media that is aligned against BLM to be illicitly influenced towards framing its reporting in this delegitimising fashion.</p>\n<p>That we are non-ideal agents is therefore highly relevant in this situation. We know that we may be susceptible to framing techniques that seek to discredit BLM, and we also know that should we consume media from across the political spectrum, we are highly likely to encounter those techniques. Following Worsnip’s suggested obligation would therefore pose a risk to BLM by making pernicious facts salient to a larger number of people.</p>\n<p>If we think that supporting BLM is a moral obligation, then it would follow that we are obliged to avoid putting support for BLM at risk by making ourselves susceptible to discrediting techniques. This would constitute an obligation to avoid diversifying our media consumption in relation to BLM that would apply broadly to all people who are obliged to support BLM. Given this generalises out to all positive social movements that we are obliged to support, we consequently have a broad limit on Worsnip’s obligation. Now recall the distinction drawn between reason and obligation. That the obligation would be so often defeated suggests that we have a reason, not obligation, to diversify our media intake.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Response and Rebuttal </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before closing, I will consider two potential responses to my argument. First, we will look at a question regarding the extent of the limit I have argued for. We will then consider the importance of the distinction between epistemic and moral obligations.</p>\n<p>Worsnip might agree that there are limits on the obligation to diversify our media consumption, but say that this is not the same as saying there is no obligation <em>as such</em>. It might be that we have a general obligation, but that it does not apply in the cases I have outlined. Perhaps I should not diversify my intake on social issues, but should do in other cases like on the economy.</p>\n<p>I have two issues with this response. First, the non-ideal aspect of the theory makes it difficult to see how actionable the advice to “diversify your media consumption, but only on some issues” really is. Sifting through publications looking for “safe” reports while avoiding the riskier ones is error prone for agents like us. Second is that I am not sure how many issues really are both important enough that we are obliged to be informed on them and free of any type of positive movement that can be undermined via pernicious reporting. It seems to me that for any given important issue, there is some side which I am under a moral obligation to support. For each, the argument regarding BLM will go through<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/do-we-have-an-obligation-to-diversify-our-media-consumption/#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a response based on the distinction between epistemic and moral obligations. Epistemic obligations are derived from requirements of rationality, whereas moral obligations are based on requirements of morality. Worsnip is arguing for an epistemic obligation; it is an obligation based on the premise that we do better epistemically when we diversify our body of evidence. I, on the other hand, have been arguing that there may be countervailing moral obligations, but it is not obvious that we could not be obliged epistemically in one direction but morally in the other.</p>\n<p>I will not be attempting to offer a full account of the relation between epistemic and moral obligation here. I will instead settle with noting two problems that may emerge should Worsnip rely on this distinction in their defence. Firstly, Worsnip thinks that the obligation to diversify your sources is a case of moral and epistemic obligations “lining up”, but my objection shows that in many cases, this is not true<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/do-we-have-an-obligation-to-diversify-our-media-consumption/#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Second is that if moral and epistemic obligations do come apart as I have suggested, that would be a severe limit on said epistemic obligations. It seems to me that in these situations we do better to think of ourselves as having an epistemic reason that is defeated by our moral obligations. This would be a rejection of (6) in Worsnip’s argument.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Conclusion </strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This essay has argued that we have no obligation to diversify our media consumption. We began by looking at Worsnip’s argument to the contrary and his understanding of illicit influence. I then refuted Worsnip’s argument by looking at obligations to support positive social movements. If that argument goes through, then broad limits on the obligation will emerge. We would do better to take ourselves as having a mere reason to diversify our media consumption.</p>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/do-we-have-an-obligation-to-diversify-our-media-consumption/#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> (Worsnip, 2019)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/do-we-have-an-obligation-to-diversify-our-media-consumption/#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> (Banks, 2018)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/do-we-have-an-obligation-to-diversify-our-media-consumption/#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> Incidentally, this issue is why Worsnip cannot rely on his exception of publications that are “beyond the pale”. (Worsnip, 2019, Pg 258) Worsnip agrees that we are not obliged to consume publications that push immoral view points.

Assuming some form of moderation is permissible, I will discuss how/whether SMCs should use AI to moderate. To this end, I outline CM AI should respect users ‘moral agency’ (‘MA’) through transparency, clarity, and providing an option to appeal the AI’s judgment. I then address whether AI failing to respect MA proscribes its use. It does not. SMCs are permitted<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[1]</a> to use AI, despite procedural failures, to discharge substantive obligations to users and owners.</p>\n<p>This essay will demonstrate that:</p>\n<p>\n1) Respect for user’s MA entails SMCs should use AI in a:</p><p>\na.

It is a necessary means of discharging important obligations.</p><p><strong>Ideal CM AI</strong></p>\n<p>\nPeople have rights we should respect. This cred is the basis of this essay. However, rights include substantive rights such as to expression. Here, I am presuming that any moderated content is a legitimate target. Hence, moderating this content simpliciter does not violate users’ rights because SMCs could permissibly moderate the post/user.</p><p>The question that remains is what ‘procedural-rights’ users possess. How should SMCs respect users whilst moderating? Here, I address the procedural-rights users have because of their ‘moral agency’ (‘MA’).</p>\n<p>MA is the capacity of an agent to understand moral reasons. Respecting the dignity of a person involves treating them as a moral-agent<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[2]</a>. This requires engagement in moral reasoning<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[3]</a>. Moral reasoning is the process of giving reasons concerning the justification of an act. Engagement in moral reasoning acknowledges one’s MA and dignity – a basic Kantian requirement<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[4]</a>.</p>\n<p>Applying MA to Moderation</p>\n<p>\nModeration is akin to punishment. H.L.A Hart defined punishment “in terms of five elements:</p><p>\n1. …consequences…considered unpleasant.</p><p>\n2. …for an offence against…rules.</p><p>\n3. …of an…offender for his offence.</p><p>\n4. …intentionally administered by [another] and</p><p>\n5. …administered by an authority constituted by the…system.”<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[5]</a></p><p>Moderation removes posts and restricts access to platform features which is unpleasant. It occurs to ‘offenders’ for breaching the community guidelines. It is intentionally administered by SMCs which created authorities who impose moderation. It satisfies Hart’s 5 elements.</p>\n<p>If moderation is punishment, then respecting MA in the process of moderation will be similar to respecting MA in the process of criminal punishment. That involves giving reasons why the act/offence was wrongful, and why the response to the act/offence was just.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[6]</a></p>\n<p>Hence, SMCs respect users’ MA whilst moderating if they:</p>\n<p>\n1) Provide moral reasons to users why they ought not post certain content and;</p><p>\n2) Provide moral reasons to users why they are moderating<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[7]</a></p><p>SMCs should give users reasons why the guidelines were violated, and why moderation was the right response. CM AI must be, in other words, <em>transparent</em><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[8]</a>.</p>\n<p>Respect for MA requires more than granting reasons. It requires the option of appealing an AI’s judgement to a human moderator.</p>\n<p>“Penalizing someone for violating the rules…reasserts our shared values…calling something hate speech…is a….performative assertion that something should be treated as hate speech and…undoubtedly, it will be disagreed with” <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[9]</a>.</p>\n<p>Users should be free to question whether such an assertion is an accurate representation of the guidelines. A moral-agent is also a giver, not merely a receiver, of reasons. To engage in the moral reasoning which respects one’s MA, SMCs should give users the option to justify their post.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, to respect users, AI should use rules which are prospectively clear. Respecting people as moral-agents is to regard them as able to follow rules they are aware of<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[10]</a>. Part of what legitimizes punishment is that the user could have complied with the rule.</p>\n<p>To respect users as moral-agents, AI should facilitate users’ compliance with rules. CM AI should be:</p>\n<p>\ni) Based on rules;</p><p>\nii) Which are published;</p><p>\niii) Prospective,</p><p>\niv) Intelligible;</p><p>\nv) Free from contradiction;</p><p>\nvi) Possible to follow;</p><p>\nvii) Not constantly changing and;</p><p>\nviii) With congruence between the rule and official actions.<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[11]</a></p><p>If CM AI satisfies these eight principles, then it respects users by recognizing their MA and furthermore, providing rational freedom.</p>\n<p>Moral-agents should not face ‘bolts-from-the-blue’. Their freedom should not be dependant on an AI’s whims. The guidelines that the AI follows should allow users to know whether they are in, and avoid, non-compliance.</p>\n<p>This prospective clarity enhances the morality of CM AI by providing ‘freedom from domination’:</p>\n<p>“[freedom] is not…the availability of…choices. It is conceivable that a free man might have fewer options…than a slave…[But] we think of slavery as the…embodiment of unfreedom…because…the conditions under which he enjoys…options…are…dependant upon the will of the master.”<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[12]</a></p>\n<p>Clear rules liberate one from dependence/domination. A user’s freedom is not dependant on the SMC but rather, on the rules which equally constrain moderators.</p>\n<p>But why accept that ‘punishment’ by SMCs should respect moral agency? State punishment of crimes might need to – but why content moderation?</p>\n<p>Because all should respect each other as moral agents. To do otherwise is to disrespect our dignity. Insofar as moral agency is only consistent with certain procedures of punishment by the state, I see no reason why (as an ideal matter) it would impose fundamentally different requires on punishment by family, friends, strangers, or crucially here – SMCs.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<p>\nModeration is punishment. To respect MA whilst punishing, SMCs must use transparent AI which gives users reasons to justify SMCs’ response. Furthermore, respecting MA requires that AI decisions are appealable to a human moderator. This provides the opportunity for moral discourse which further respects MA. Lastly, respecting MA requires that the AI’s decisions allow the user to prospectively avoid non-compliance.</p><p><strong>Unideal AI?</strong></p>\n<p>\nWhilst the prior section explored how a CM AI can respect user’s MA, it neglected two questions. Does CM AI currently respect MA? If it does not, should SMCs continue to use AI which violates procedural rights?</p><p>The answer to the first question is no. “A common critique of automated decision making is the…lack of transparency…[It is]…difficult to decipher…the specific criteria by which…decisions were made”<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[13]</a>. Furthermore, systems of appeal, such as Facebook’s “Supreme Court”, are available to very few users<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[14]</a>. <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[15]</a>.</p>\n<p>The answer to the second question – should SMCs use unideal AI – is complicated.</p>\n<p>One could answer: if MA should be respected, then SMCs are not at liberty to use CM AI unless it respects user’s MA. In short, if CM AI is not transparent, appealable, and prospectively clear, it should not be used.</p>\n<p>This view is flawed because SMCs do not only have process obligations. They have substantive obligations to their users and owners.</p>\n<p>For its users, SMCs could be obligated to prevent the spread of toxic content, terrorist propaganda or child exploitation. To do otherwise is to become complicit. Christopher Bennet explained this complicity, and its corollary obligations, as resulting from ‘normative control’: “control over whether the…act is done with permission or not”<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[16]</a><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[17]</a>. <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[18]</a>. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, SMCs have shareholders/investors. “A corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his employers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make…money”<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[19]</a>. When an agent is managing money belonging to another, we traditionally accept she is obliged to act with regard for the principal’s interests. Those same obligations bind all SMCs baring those which are owner operated<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[20]</a>.</p>\n<p>These substantive obligations answer whether SMCs should use imperfect AI, because using CM AI is crucial for discharging of these duties. Even if AI is imperfect, SMCs are obliged to use it for CM; CM AI is needed to SMC’s obligations to different stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Given SMCs’ size general size, CM requires AI. Yan LeCunn – Facebook’s chief AI scientist – has stated that: “Without AI there would not be any possibility of…speech filtering, detecting harassment, child exploitation, or terrorist propaganda”<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[21]</a>. </p>\n<p>A potential response is that it is “size…that makes automation seem necessary… [and]…size can be changed”<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[22]</a>. Specifically, “if moderation is…overwhelming at…scale, it should be understood as a limiting factor on…growth”<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[23]</a>. SMCs should accept making less profit to reduce the need for CM AI.</p>\n<p>However, this neglects their obligations to owners. Even if SMC could make moderation respect users MA by setting growth aside, they would breach their fiduciary obligations to owners. Furthermore, SMCs are under pressure to moderate from the public. Not moderating could result in a harm to their brand, ability to recruit talent etc. Moderation is likely in owner’s interests.</p>\n<p>Not using CM AI would result in SMCs failing their substantive obligations to either its users, its owners, or more likely both. Yet, one could say that if a ‘right’ to be recognized as moral-agent exists, SMCs should not violate it. Procedural-rights are side-constraints which requires not using imperfect AI. What this neglects is that X being a right does not mean it is of equal importance to right Y. If all obligations cannot be simultaneous met, then choices must be made about which obligations should be unfulfilled.</p>\n<p>I would contend that procedural-rights in CM are some of SMCs’<em> least</em> important obligations. Users who have posted content eligible to moderation are the reason a trade-off of rights is necessary. If they had not done wrong, then the SMC would not need to decide whether to respect their procedural-rights or the substantive rights of its users or owners. If a set amount of cost must be imposed, then it seems appropriate to apply that cost upon the individual most responsible – the user being moderated<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[24]</a></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>\nSocial Media Companies should use artificial intelligence to automate content moderation. The use of this technology is needed to meet SMCs’ substantive obligations to their users and owners. That means that the conditions under which it should be used are broad. Even if, AI moderation does not respect user’s moral agency, it should still be used. Nevertheless, where possible, SMCs should work to bring its AI moderation more in line with an ideal of respect. This Ideal AI Content Moderation would be transparent (capable of giving users the reasons which underpin the moderation decision) with an option to appeal to a human moderator (as a recognition of the two-sided nature of moral reasoning). Furthermore, the AI should operate on clear, prospective, and reasonably predictable rules such that users are given a freedom from domination and are spared from moderation happening like a ‘bolt-from-the-blue’.</p><p>\nAI moderation is a necessity for SMCs.</p><p>\nThey should use AI moderation to meet their substantive obligations whilst striving for the procedural ideal.</p><hr>\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftn1\">[1]</a> Perhaps obliged.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftnref1\">[2]</a> (Strawson, 1962).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftnref1\">[3]</a> (Hirsch, 1993).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftnref1\">[4]</a> (Jacobs, 2019, p. 29) (Seelmann, 2014).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftnref1\">[5]</a> (Hart, 2008, pp. 5-6).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2023/03/should-social-media-companies-use-artificial-intelligence-to-automate-content-moderation-on-their-platforms-and-if-so-under-what-conditions/#_ftnref1\">[6]</a> (Edwards &amp;

What if there were only a 70% chance the five people would die?</p>\n<p>These questions sound like they have nothing to do with a government budget. These annual events are, after all, conveyed as an endeavour in accounting. They are a chance to show anticipated tax revenues and propose public spending. We are told the name of the game is “fiscal responsibility” and the goal is stimulating “economic growth”. Never do we talk of budgets in terms of sacrificing some lives to save others.</p>\n<p>In reality, though, government budgets are a lot like those trains, in philosophical terms. Whether explicitly intended or not, some of us take those trains to better or similar destinations, and some of us will be left strapped to the tracks. That is because the real business of budgets is in distributing death and life. They are exercises in allocating misery and happiness.</p>\n<p>Take the austerity policies introduced by the UK government in 2010 and the following years. Studies put the mortality cost of spending cuts between 2010 and 2014 at approximately <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/11/e017722\">150,000 excess deaths</a>. A more recent study suggested that <a href=\"https://jech.bmj.com/content/jech/early/2022/09/26/jech-2022-219645.full.pdf\">335,000</a> excess deaths could be attributed to the austerity of the 2010s.</p>\n<p>These are contestable figures – and they cannot draw a direct causal relationship between specific austerity policies and number of deaths. But even if it is impossible to assign an accurate death toll to austerity, it should come as no surprise that reducing welfare spending will reduce, well, welfare. The same is true in reverse. An England-focused <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34654700/\">study</a> suggests that by increasing healthcare expenditure by 1%, around 300,000 deaths could have been avoided in the wake of 2010 cuts.</p>\n<p>This has a sobering implication: knowingly or not, a decision is effectively made to let 300,000 die if healthcare expenditure isn’t increased by 1%.</p>\n<p>Similarly, there is a clear <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/cost-of-living-crisis-the-health-risks-of-not-turning-the-heating-on-in-winter-190035\">link between fuel poverty and premature deaths</a>. It is difficult to derive a precise figure, but it’s almost certain that a government decision not to further subsidise energy bills will trigger otherwise preventable deaths.</p>\n<p>There is a truism in all this: resources are limited, and decisions inevitably come with trade-offs and opportunity costs.</p>\n<p>For instance, austerity was a response to a severe economic downturn. Recessions reduce how much revenue a government has to spend on services, which leads to the loss of lives and livelihoods. Even for those who don’t suffer in the extreme, life is generally less liveable for many of us. For all we know, the global financial crisis would have (eventually) led to tens of thousands of additional deaths no matter how the government responded.</p>\n<h2>The values smuggled into budgets</h2>\n<p>Budgets are of course hugely complicated, but this is all to show that while it is true that they involve accounting, the morally relevant currency of what is being accounted for is ultimately our wellbeing, including its loss through death.</p>\n<p>For instance, assume it is indeed true that 300,000 deaths could be prevented by a 1% increase in healthcare spending. Assume also that using these funds in some other way (such as on education and home insulation) would in the long term prevent far more deaths, or, significantly improve the quality of several million lives.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, talk of fiscal responsibility seems to miss the point. We are faced with a much more philosophically loaded debate. It becomes pertinent to say, hang on, just how much extra wellbeing for some do you think can make up for the deaths of 300,000 others? And how sure are you about this?</p>\n<p>It starts to become obvious how value judgments infuse and implicitly guide these fiscal decisions that, unwittingly or not, involve weighing up certain lives against others, present lives against future ones, and proxies for wellbeing (such as job creation) against others (such as preventing premature deaths).</p>\n<p>The risk of the language of “boosting the economy” is that it gives these monumental decisions in ethics a veneer of being value-free budgetary exercises in “following the evidence”, stopping us from seeing how the economic sausage is actually made.</p>\n<p>Of course, evidence-based policy is better than unevidenced policy. What is missing is values-transparent policy, and that starts with the philosophical task of laying bare the precise value judgments that go into constructing what we’re told are “good economic outcomes”.</p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://obr.uk/about-the-obr/what-we-do/\">Office of Budget Responsibility</a> independently assesses the economic credibility of the budget, no corresponding institution works to uncover its ethical assumptions and value trade-offs. Welfare economists and ethicists need to forge a new relationship that initiates and guides the uncomfortable public conversation of how government budgets inevitably trade-off lives and livelihoods, now and against the future.</p>\n<p>Equally crucial, by instituting norms that encourage uncovering all the value-judgments smuggled beneath the guise of sanitised fiscal and economic talk, we might reduce the chances of opportunistic politicians gambling with millions of livelihoods by redirecting the train in the name of one ideology or another.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/profiles/hazem-zohny-1182359\">Hazem Zohny</a>, Research Fellow in Practical Ethics, <em><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-oxford-1260\">University of Oxford</a></em></p>\n<p>This article is republished from <a href=\"https://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Apatanis principally use three rice varieties: Emeo, Pyape and Mypia.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/vale-of-apatanis-56032\">Vale of Apatanis</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The total area of the Apatani Plateau is 10,135 square kilometres, where rice-fish culture is undertaken approximately in 592.0 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice lands out of 715.7 ha.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau is a land of diverse cultures. The major festivals of Apatanis are the Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung. People here believe that these traditional festivals ensure better productivity and well-being.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from humid subtropical to temperate. So, this plateau receives adequate rainfall during the summer season. The permeability and water-retaining capacity of the clayey, loamy soil favour this unique farming technique.</p>\n<p>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a low-input and eco-friendly practice. The stocked fish practically depend on the natural food sources of the rice fields and thus, farmers hardly need to use any supplementary fish feeds.</p>\n<p>The farmers sometimes use household and agricultural wastes and excreta of domestic animals like pigs, cows, mithun (<em>Bos frontalis</em>) and goats to make farming more sustainable and organic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, azolla and lemna are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers. The organic food grown in the field plays an essential role in feeding fish.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/recognise-empower-indigenous-land-tenure-and-title-to-achieve-sdgs-holistically-un-report-75997\">Recognise, empower indigenous land tenure and title to achieve SDGs holistically: UN Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The water sources in these high-altitude rice fields are mountain streams and rainwater trickled down during the monsoon season.</p>\n<p>Bamboo pipes are being used to distribute water from the networks of earthen irrigation channels using two outlet pipes. An outlet is fitted angularly at the upper level through a dyke to maintain the water level and another outlet is fitted at the bottom of the dyke to the exterior. It is used for dewatering the field during harvest.</p>\n<p>Men and women perform different farm duties while preparing the fields for cultivating rice. And during the culture of fish, women folk participate as the major workforce.</p>\n<p>Ancient and old-fashioned agricultural technologies are utilised for cultivation. Modern tools like tractors and power tillers are not affordable as well as inaccessible to the farmers.</p>\n<p>They mostly use agricultural tools such as <em>Dao</em> (sickle) and dibbling sticks. After preparing the field, they transplant a maximum of two-three healthy rice plants with an average distance of 26 cm from each other.</p>\n<p><span>Fish refuges are also created inside the fields. Three strains of fish species of common carp — </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiospecularis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpio communis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpionudus — </span></em><span>are stocked just after ten days from transplanting rice.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492\">Sustainable rice production key to food security</a></span></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The stocked fish are harvested twice in a season. The first and second or final harvest is done in the middle of July and October, respectively. But the rice is harvested at the end of September until the mid of October, i.e. once in a season.</span></p>\n<p><span>Four cultivars of rice are grown along with fish species of </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiol</span></em><span>. The total productivity ranges from 300-500 kilograms of fish per hectare in one season (ha-1 season-1) and 3,000-4,000 kg of rice (ha-1 season-1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish enhances rice productivity (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the mineralisation of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances rice yield here. The records of rice and fish yields were obtained from the farmers through personal interviews.</span></p>\n<p>Dykes at a higher elevation and lower elevation are constructed with a height of 0.9 m to 1.5 m and 0.4 to 0.6 m. These dykes are also used to remove water from the field during harvesting. Bamboo fencing is done to avoid the escape of fish through the pipes.</p>\n<p>This eco-friendly and economically beneficial practice has made the system unique in terms of aquatic resource utilisation.</p>\n<p>The zooplankton and algal life forms serve as natural food sources for the fish in the flooded rice fields to enhance aquatic productivity. This ecosystem service, in turn, indirectly maintains healthy human-made swamps with better livelihood options for tribal framers.</p>\n<p>Field water depth is the limiting factor. All the agro-inputs in this ecosystem with organic manures, decomposed rice stubbles and macrophytes, along with other biotic and abiotic factors, regulate their various population properties in the inundated rice fields.</p>\n<p>For growth and development, the stocked fish in the rice field may have utilised and assimilated available aquatic biomass and zooplankton through trophic interactions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, high-altitude flooded environments enriched with such natural fish feeds have sufficient scope to raise fish as a concurrent crop of rice in the same field.</p>\n<p>In the context of plankton and other fish food organisms, the wet rice fields are still data deficient. The water quality parameters, community structure and population dynamics of algal life forms under the rice canopy are favourable for the growth and abundance of zooplankton, which greatly influences the fish yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such unique integrated farming systems require special attention for better productivity and profitability to the small-scale rural farmers in Assam and other northeastern hill states.</p>\n<h3>Read more:</h3>\n<p><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of</em> Down To Earth</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

A farmer can be termed as the first person to be impacted by climate change since s/he is in a livelihood that directly depends on climate.</p>\n<p>This affects the country’s overall agricultural output and also adds to food inflation. High food prices could result in people slashing down consumption as well. This, on the other hand, impacts negatively on nutritional security.</p>\n<p>Among farming households, a significant number produce food for their own consumption. These households gave birth to the old saying that those who eat their own food are also the healthiest ones.</p>\n<p>For countries like India where malnutrition is high and food insecurity is a nagging constant, such households have used the home production system to remain out of it.</p>\n<p>As many studies point out, these households are also protected from market fluctuations thus ensuring their affordability for healthy food. Obviously, they are not impacted by food inflation as well.</p>\n<p>But serious conversations are taking place over how climate change-induced extreme weather events would impact such households. To begin with, we need to know the linkage between nutrition intake and household food production; and whether weather fluctuation would have any impact on this.</p>\n<p>A recent research paper from the <a href=\"https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136557/filename/136768.pdf\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) attempts to answer the first question: How much do weather conditions impact a home food production system?</p>\n<p>Researchers Hiroyuki Takeshima, Sunil Saroj and Anjani Kumar have analysed village-level data from households on their own food production and consumption and correlated the local weather situations to infer whether there was a significant relationship.</p>\n<p>The IFPRI paper first established that people growing their own food consume more, thus adding to nutrition level and also attaining overall food security. “On average, growing grain crops at home led to Rs 12.184 higher average grain consumption per month per household,” found the research paper.</p>\n<p>This trend is not limited only to grains. Consumption increases significantly for pulses, dairy, vegetables and fruits, if grown at home. The research could establish a link between increased consumption and reduction in child stunting, underweight and women achieving normal body-mass-index. These trends are more pronounced in remote villages.</p>\n<p>But these ‘positive effects’ of growing your own food are observed to be ‘significantly magnified’ if the weather is closer to normal. This is the most definitive linkage of climate and food intake established by this research paper among the food-growing households.</p>\n<p>If the rainfall is one standard deviation closer to the normal figure, grain consumption increases by Rs 12.282. Similarly, if the temperature is one standard deviation from normal, consumption increases by Rs 5.723. This also means that normal weather will increase all other physical benefits.</p>\n<p>This implies that if these households experience adverse weather conditions, their overall food and nutritional security would be negatively impacted. Also, without normal weather, they may have to depend more on markets thus spending more on food than before. This would have an impact on overall economic well being.</p>\n<p>This makes the case for climate-proofing these food producers who till now remain untouched from the crisis. Moreover, these are the people who are yet to be impacted by the market-driven agriculture system. While climate change takes all under its grips, this system of food production needs a prudent reaction.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

          "title": "How an indictment and arrest of Donald Trump could unfold",
          "description": "",
          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"4.713812154696132\" morss_score=\"82.63316699340581\">\n<p>But much about what comes next remains unclear. Prosecutors have signaled that an indictment is likely, but it is not a certainty. Before Trump can be charged, the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, must ask the grand jury that has been hearing evidence about the former president to vote on whether to charge him. A majority of jurors must agree to do so.</p><p>The timing of any potential indictment, arrest and arraignment is unknown and likely to remain so after a vote is conducted.</p>\n<p>The investigation, conducted by Bragg’s office, has been focused on Trump’s involvement in the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/donald-trump-arrest-porn-star-stormy-daniels-case-8507901/\"><strong>payment of hush money to a porn actress</strong></a> during the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Here’s what we know and don’t know about the course of the investigation and what might happen in the days ahead.</p>\n<h2>When might Trump be indicted?</h2>\n<p>The special grand jury that has been hearing testimony meets three afternoons a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. At least one more witness could be called before jurors are asked to vote, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>Once all the witnesses have testified, prosecutors must explain the criminal charges they are seeking to the jury of 23 Manhattan residents before asking them to vote. The earliest that could happen is Wednesday afternoon. A simple majority is all that is required to hand up an indictment.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n\n<div>Best of Explained</div><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/express-explained/\"><span>Click here for more</span></a> \n<h2>How soon could Trump be arrested?</h2>\n<p>If Trump is indicted, prosecutors would most likely work with his legal team to arrange his surrender in Manhattan. Within several days of his indictment, Trump, who lives at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, would travel to the city and turn himself in at the district attorney’s office in lower Manhattan. Hours later, he would be arraigned in a courtroom in the same building.</p>\n<p>Any indictment of Trump would almost certainly be sealed, and the charges would be kept secret from the public after the grand jurors vote. The unsealing of the indictment — and a public announcement of the charges against him — would coincide with his surrender and arraignment.</p>\n<p>However, there is some chance that Trump does not surrender — there have been differing reports on that possibility — which could kick off a more complex scenario.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Might Trump avoid indictment entirely?</h2>\n<p>Trump’s lawyers have met with prosecutors in hopes of warding off criminal charges, and while it is unlikely, there is a faint possibility that Bragg will opt not to seek an indictment (or that he will seek one and grand jurors will vote to reject it).</p>\n<p>But prosecutors have broad discretion during grand jury proceedings, and the defense has almost no role. Every available signal has suggested that an indictment is imminent.</p>\n<div><span>Also Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/vladimir-putin-arrest-warrant-ukraine-war-crimes-international-criminal-court-8504268/\">ICC issues arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin for war crimes in Ukraine: What does this mean?</a></div>\n<h2>What might the charges be?</h2>\n<p>While it is clear that Manhattan prosecutors have been investigating the role Trump played in a hush-money payment to the porn actress, Stormy Daniels, the specific criminal charges prosecutors could seek are unknown — and will probably remain so even after he is indicted.</p>\n<p>People with knowledge of the matter have suggested the charges would stem from the falsification of business records that recorded reimbursements to Michael Cohen — Trump’s former lawyer and fixer and the prosecution’s star witness — as legal fees. Such a charge, combined with a second crime involving illegal campaign contributions, could rise to a low-level felony.</p>\n<h2>How do you arrest a former president?</h2>\n<p>Some of the routine steps that follow any felony arrest in New York would apply to the former president as they would to anyone else: He would be photographed, fingerprinted and read a standard Miranda warning offering him the right to remain silent.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>But because of Trump’s status as a former president — and his round-the-clock Secret Service detail — prosecutors are likely to make some accommodations. He could be held in an interview room instead of a cell; the investigators who process his arrest may forgo handcuffs.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement agencies around New York have also had discussions about how to prepare for the prospect of protests, which Trump called for explicitly on his social media site, Truth Social, over the weekend. A protest in Manhattan on Monday evening was sparsely attended.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n\n<h3>Will Trump be held in jail?</h3>\n<p>Because of the nature of the potential charges against Trump, the law does not allow prosecutors to seek to have him held on bail. And as a leading presidential candidate, he is far from a flight risk.</p>\n<p>Trump will almost certainly be released shortly after he is arraigned.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h3>What happens after that?</h3>\n<p>Once Trump has been charged, the case against him will probably be mired in protracted litigation. Should the matter eventually make it to trial, it could conceivably play out in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election — with Trump, the defendant, in the thick of his campaign.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Written by William K.

He, along with his nephew <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-is-nirav-modi-punjab-national-bank-fraud-case-5064606/\">Nirav Modi</a>, are wanted in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam. Choksi and Modi are accused of conniving with bank officials to have fraudulent Letters of Undertaking (LoU) and Foreign Letters of Credit issued to companies owned by them. In this case, no securities were kept by the PNB before issuing the LoUs.</p><p>The case came to light in January 2018, when the PNB submitted a fraud report to the Reserve Bank of India. CBI filed an <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/fir-cognizable-offence-ipc-explained-7780266/\">FIR</a> in the case a week later. By this time, Choksi had already fled the country</p>\n<p>Choksi is wanted in India for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, cheating and financial misappropriation. An arrest warrant has been issued against him.</p>\n<p>Choksi had acquired the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 and was living there from 2018. However, he went missing from Antigua and Barbuda on May 23, 2021, and was soon caught in Dominica. While Choksi claimed he was kidnapped, he was charged with illegal entry by the police in Dominica. In May last year, Dominica dropped these charges against him.</p>\n<p><strong>What is an Interpol Red Notice</strong></p>\n<p>Criminals or suspects often flee to other countries to evade facing justice. A Red Corner Notice, or Red Notice (RN) alerts police forces across the world about fugitives who are wanted internationally.</p>\n<p>Interpol says “Red Notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>RNs contain information that helps identify wanted persons, such as their names, dates of birth, nationality, and physical attributes such as the colour of their hair and eyes, as well as pictures and biometric data such as fingerprints, if they are available. RNs also mention the crime(s) they are wanted for.</p>\n<p>An RN is only an international wanted persons’ notice; it is not an international arrest warrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Why was the Red Notice issued against Choksi?</strong></p>\n<p>The Red Notice was issued against Choksi in December 2018 on a request from the CBI and Enforcement Directorate. His appeals against the decision were rejected in 2020.</p>\n<p><strong>Why has it been revoked?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Welcoming the Interpol’s decision, Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal told ANI that the withdrawal of the Red Notice comes after the “genuine claim of kidnapping” by the fugitive diamantaire. “Ultimately, truth has prevailed as the kidnapping attempt of my client is not approved by the international community, RCN issued against my client by Interpol has been removed”.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the move mean for Choksi?</strong></p>\n<p>The removal of the Red Notice means Choksi can travel around the world freely without any fear of being arrested by law enforcement agencies. The exception is India, where he faces multiple cases. This also weakens India’s efforts to extradite him.</p>\n<p><strong>What has the CBI said?</strong></p>\n<p>The CBI said that the CCF’s decision is “based on mere imaginary conjunctures and unproven surmises”. It said the CCF has subsequently clarified to CBI that its decision in no manner has any determination on any guilt or innocence of Mehul Chinubhai Choksi for crimes he remains charged in India.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the reactions to the withdrawal of the Red Notice?</strong></p>\n<p>The Congress said that while the Opposition was being targeted by the Enforcement Directorate and CBI, the Central government’s “friend” was being let off. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said talk of patriotism by those giving “protection” to such people is a “joke”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In a tweet, former Congress chief <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a> said, “‘Vipaksh ko ED, CBI, Mitr ko rihaai’ (ED, CBI for the Opposition, let off for friend).” “‘Modani’ model matlab pehle looto, phir bin sazaa ke chooto’ (Modani model means first loot and then go scott-free without punishment),” he said.</p>\n<p>Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala stated, “Modi Govt ‘Red Faced’ India by failing to prevent Mehul Choksi’s removal from Interpol’s List of Red Corner Notices!”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, AAP’s Raghav Chadha also hit out the government for targeting the Opposition with fake cases, while Choksi lives scot-free.</p>\n</div> ",

In the Banco Popular case, alongside bonds, equity was also written off; the Credit Suisse-UBS deal brokered by the Swiss financial regulator FINMA entails a complete write-down of the bank’s AT1 bonds, even as equity shareholders are set to receive about 3 billion Swiss francs.</p>\n<p>The action reverses what is typically a settled principle of write-downs: shareholders take the hit ahead of bondholders. While AT1 securities are considered the most risky among bonds, in the right-to-payouts list, AT1 bondholders come after senior bondholders but are ahead of equity shareholders — who are theoretically exposed to losses upfront.</p>\n\n<p>Reuters reported that UBS CEO Ralph Hamers told analysts that the decision to write down the AT1 bonds to zero was taken by FINMA, so it would not create a liability for the bank. But the regulator’s action goes against the traditional flow of things and threatens to plunge European bond markets into turmoil.</p>\n<p><strong>Bond market impact</strong></p>\n<p>At nearly $130 trillion, the global bond market far outweighs the stock market in size, and plays an outsize role in the global financial system, especially in the way governments raise funds to manage their deficits. Rumblings in the bond markets could make it harder for other lenders to raise new AT1 debt, especially when the financial sector is facing tough times. AT1s, introduced in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis as a bankable debt market instrument, pay higher interest as they carry greater risk than regular debt.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Following FINMA’s announcement of the CHF 16 billion (about $17.3 billion) write-down of Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds, European and Asian AT1 bonds tanked on Monday. UBS’ AT1s with a 2025 call slid to around 85 cents on the dollar compared with 93 cents on Friday, according to Tradeweb data quoted by Reuters.</p>\n<p><strong>European vs US crisis</strong></p>\n<p>There are specific, and somewhat distinct, triggers for the unfolding banking sector crises on either side of the Atlantic. Credit Suisse was partly a victim of bond market losses, but multiple other factors were at play in its downfall: a poor governance record and chequered investment decision-making, which saw the bank lurching from scandal to scandal over much of the last decade, and it was repeatedly categorised as Europe’s weakest “systemically important” bank.</p>\n<p>In the US, the triggers were different. Over 90 per cent of deposits at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank were uninsured, and thereby prone to bank runs. These banks were also invested heavily in long-term government bonds — and when interest rates rose, the value of their bond portfolios declined. They sold some bonds to raise funds, and when these losses came to light, panicky depositors rushed to pull out.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>There was also an asset-liability mismatch in SVB’s case: being overly exposed to the same profile of funders and customers — venture capital funds and start-ups.</p>\n<p>Troubles in the banking sector and the wider bond market are likely to be high on the agenda of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Wednesday. This is especially important as analysts point to a soft landing of the economy as being less of a possibility today than recessionary risk.</p>\n\n<div>Best of Explained</div><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/express-explained/\"><span>Click here for more</span></a> \n<p><strong>Impact on Indian banks</strong></p>\n<p>The decision to write down Credit Suisse’s AT1 bonds to zero after the lender’s takeover by UBS may contribute to a higher cost of capital for banks, including Indian lenders, S&amp;P Global Ratings said on Tuesday. The write-down will weigh on the pricing of such notes and spook investors, Citi analysts said in a note.</p>\n<p>In India, AT1 bonds of Yes Bank were written down in March 2020 after the Reserve Bank of India initiated a restructuring of the troubled lender. Since then, Indian banks have raised AT1 bonds at an up to 75 basis points premium over government bonds, Citi noted.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Some bankers, however, do not see a major impact on the fundraising capabilities of Indian banks through AT1 bonds — one reason for the optimism is that the spread between regular bonds and AT1 bonds in India is less than 150 basis points, while in the EU and the US, it is 200-250 bps. Jefferies said in a note that Indian lenders have “limited dependence” on such securities.</p>\n<p>S&amp;P noted that Indian lenders are capable of “enduring any potential contagion effects” emanating from the US banking turmoil and the Credit Suisse episode “given their manageable exposures” to global counterparts. “Strong funding profiles, a high savings rate, and government support are among the factors that bolster the financial institutions we rate,” the rating agency said, adding that domestic banks had sufficient buffers to withstand losses on their government securities portfolio due to rising interest rates.</p>\n</div> ",

Four of these were recorded in just the last one year. Depending on how deep below the Earth’s surface they originate, the shocks from some of these are felt in northern parts of India as well.</p><div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/why-north-india-felt-big-tremors-of-an-earthquake-in-afghanistan-8511164/\">Why parts of North India felt big tremors of a 6.5-magnitude earthquake in Afghanistan</a></div>\n<p>Tuesday night’s earthquake originated 187 km below the surface, according to USGS. The Hindu Kush region usually experiences deep earthquakes, originating at a depth of 100 km or below. Deep earthquakes, if sufficiently strong, are felt over large geographical areas, because in travelling radially upwards to the earth’s surface, they spread over great distances. The terrain in Afghanistan extending into northern India has lots of solid rocks which are conducive to wave propagation.</p>\n<p>However, precisely because they have to traverse long distances, deep earthquakes are also generally weaker, losing a substantial part of their energy during the travel. So even though the tremors continued for 15-20 seconds in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a> and adjoining areas, they are unlikely to have caused much damage.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is not the first time that northern India has been shaken prominently by earthquakes in Afghanistan. In 2015, about six months after the powerful Nepal earthquake, a 7.5-magnitude quake in roughly the same area in Afghanistan had rattled most of north India. It was a similar story in January 2018 as well. In all these instances, the earthquakes had originated more than 150 km below the surface.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake in southern Tajikistan, a couple of hundred km north from the location of Tuesday’s quake, last month was not felt anywhere in India because it was very shallow, originating just 11 km below the surface.</p>\n<p>The Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan experiences unique tectonic forces and is a site of frequent earthquakes. On one side it feels the forces of the Indian tectonic plate getting under the Himalayas, a phenomenon that is occurring throughout the Himalayan ranges. From the other side, the Eurasian plate is subducting into the Pamir mountain ranges. In addition, there are local faultlines as well.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Deep earthquakes also are more unlikely to be followed by aftershocks. No aftershocks were reported from Afghanistan on Tuesday. In contrast, the 7.8 earthquake in Turkey last month was followed by nearly a hundred big and small aftershocks.</p>\n</div> ",

Deep earthquakes tend to be felt over large distances, which is why tremors were experienced in Punjab, Rajasthan’s Jaipur, and Jammu and Kashmir.</p><p>The epicentre of the earthquake was near Jurm in northeastern Afghanistan, about 300 km north of Kabul, quite close to Afghanistan’s borders with Tajikistan, according to the USGS. This is an earthquake-prone region where six-plus earthquakes are not rare. A similar 6.1 magnitude earthquake had occurred very close to this place in 2018 as well, which again was felt through most of northern India.</p>\n<p>A 6.1 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan killed over 1,000 people last year.</p>\n<p><strong>How big is the earthquake?</strong></p>\n<p>How much damage an earthquake will cause depends on its depth and magnitude.</p>\n<p>Shallow earthquakes are generally more devastating because they carry greater energy when they emerge on the surface. Deeper earthquakes lose much of their energy by the time they come to the surface. The deeper quakes spread farther — the seismic waves move radially upwards to the surface — even as they lose energy while travelling greater distances, and hence cause less damage. Thus, the current tremors are unlikely to cause much damage in India.</p>\n<p>This earthqauke was of 6.5-magnitude. Magnitude is a measure of how big the waves are, while the strength refers to the energy it carries. Magnitude is measured on a logarithmic scale, which means the seismic waves produced by a magnitude 6 earthquake have 10 times higher amplitude than the ones produced by a magnitude 5 earthquake. The energy differential is even higher, 32 times for every change of 1 in magnitude.</p>\n<p><strong>Western Himalayas risky zone</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Western Himalayas continues to be the one of the most dangerous seismic zones in the world. Scientists say the Himalayan region, the 2500-km stretch from the Hindu Kush mountains to the end of Arunachal Pradesh, is due for a big earthquake, of a magnitude over 8 on Richter scale, anytime. This is because of the huge amount of energy stored along the faultlines due to the continuous interaction of different techtonic plates. The energy can be released only in the form of massive earthquakes.</p>\n<p><strong>Earthquakes remain unpredictable</strong></p>\n<p>Earthquakes continue to remain the most <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-sci-tech/turkey-syria-earthquakes-seismically-active-zone-the-science-of-quakes-8427982/\">common natural hazard that cannot be predicted</a></strong>. As such, no early warning systems can be developed.</p>\n<p>Theoretically, it is possible to offer a lead time of a few seconds between the time of the origin of the earthquake and the time it reaches the Earth’s surface. Seismic waves travel significantly slower than the speed of light — between 5 and 13 km per second. So if the earthquake is detected as soon as it is triggered, information about it can be related a few seconds ahead of it reaching the ground.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Such systems are already in use in some locations to issue alerts about earthquakes. However, these are not predictions. The alerts are issued post-event.</p>\n<p>Attempts to find reliable predictors to earthquakes have not been fruitful so far. Scientists have been able to map the areas that are earthquake prone, and are likely to generate earthquakes in future, but there is no way to predict when.</p>\n</div> ",

He fled India in January 2018, days before the CBI booked him and his nephew <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/nirav-modi-case-court-pulls-up-banks-for-not-complying-with-its-orders-8505604/\"><strong>Nirav Modi</strong></a> in the case. He had by then acquired the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda, and is since fighting the Indian government’s efforts to bring him back to the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Why was the RCN withdrawn?</strong></p>\n<p>A Red Notice, according to the Interpol, is “a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action”. The withdrawal of the RCN against Choksi — issued by the Interpol in 2018 — means he can now travel without restrictions anywhere in the world, except in India.</p>\n<p>Choksi had appealed against the notice earlier too, but his demand was rejected in 2020. <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/cbi-seeks-restoration-of-red-notice-against-mehul-choksi-agency-statement-8510442/\">According to the CBI statement</a></strong>, in 2022, he approached the CCF, a separate body within Interpol that is not under the control of INTERPOL Secretariat and is mainly staffed by elected lawyers from different countries “to revise its earlier decision of 2020.” “…based on mere imaginary conjunctures and unproven surmises, a five member CCF chamber has taken a decision on deletion of Red Notice,” the CBI said.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Choksi’s lawyer in India, Vijay Aggarwal, said on March 20, “Because of the efforts of the legal team and the genuineness of my client’s case, his RCN has been cancelled, and ultimately truth has prevailed.”</p>\n<p><strong>What charges does Choksi face in India?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Choksi is facing criminal proceedings by both CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED). The CBI had first named Choksi and his firms, including Gitanjali Gems, in 2018, based on a complaint by the PNB over the issuance of fraudulent Letters of Undertaking in their favour, causing losses to the bank.</p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-what-are-the-criminal-charges-that-mehul-choksi-is-facing-in-india-7333023/\">ED also subsequently filed a complaint alleging that Choksi</a></strong> and others were involved in money-laundering the proceeds of crime in overseas accounts. Choksi has been booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and other sections pertaining to cheating, criminal conspiracy of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.</p>\n<p>A similar case was also filed against Choksi’s nephew <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-is-nirav-modi-punjab-national-bank-fraud-case-5064606/\">Nirav Modi</a>, alleging that they both colluded with some staffers of PNB to perpetrate the multi-crore fraud.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In December last year, the CBI booked Choksi in a fresh case of loan fraud. In the new case, he has been accused of defrauding and diverting loan funds to the tune of over Rs 6,700 crore.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the status of extradition efforts?</strong></p>\n<p>Choksi has claimed that by virtue of acquiring the citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda, he has ceased to be an Indian citizen. Choksi acquired Antiguan citizenship just over a month before he fled India in January 2018, making use of the country’s Citizenship by Investment (CIP) programme, under which an individual can acquire an Antigua and Barbuda passport by investing USD 100,000.</p>\n<p>Indian authorities, however, say that while Choksi may have surrendered his passport, <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-dominica-dropped-case-mehul-choksi-india-efforts-bring-him-back-7932348/\">India has not accepted this</a></strong>, and a certificate of surrender of passport has not been issued to him.</p>\n<p>India had made efforts to bring him back when Choksi was arrested in Dominica in May 2021 on charges of illegal entry. Choksi had then alleged he was honey trapped and then abducted by “Indian agents”, who brought him to Dominica from Antigua and Barbuda. But the Dominican court granted him bail and allowed him to return to Antigua. About a year later, in May 2022, charges against Choksi were dropped by Dominica.</p>\n</div> ",

And United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Xi’s visit to Moscow was an indication that “China feels no responsibility to hold the Kremlin accountable for the atrocities committed in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/russia-invasion-ukraine-history-creation-explained-7791147/\">Ukraine</a>”.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What does Xi hope to achieve by this visit to meet Putin?</strong></p>\n<p>The China-Russia relationship matters to Beijing for several reasons.</p>\n<p>One, from the point of view of security, it is imperative for Beijing to maintain both outreach and cordial relations with Moscow.</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/arrest-warrant-putin-power-icc-russian-president-8505138/\">Arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin: What powers does the ICC have against the Russian president</a></div>\n<p>It must be remembered that the former Soviet Union and China had a history of both cooperation and violent clashes during the Cold War. Some objective conditions have not changed despite the fall of the Soviet Union and its successor’s considerably less significant global political and economic influence — Russia is still China’s largest neighbour, a major source of military technology, and continues to exercise influence in the former Soviet states that border China’s troubled west. Additionally, Russia is now a major source of hydrocarbon energy as well as a market for China’s manufacturing and technology.</p>\n<p>Just as importantly, Xi Jinping sees in Vladimir Putin an ally in the opposition to Western liberal ideas and a US-led global order.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The Chinese under Xi meant every word when they declared a partnership with “no limits” during Putin’s visit to Beijing in early February 2022 on the eve of his invasion of Ukraine. To the Chinese, Western sanctions against Russia are an example of what a new Chinese document on their Global Security Initiative calls “abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction”.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese call for the International Criminal Court (ICC) “to take an objective and just position, respect the jurisdictional immunity of a head of state under international law, prudently exercise its mandate in accordance with the law, interpret and apply international law in good faith”, might actually find several takers across the world — no matter the violation of international law that the Ukraine invasion represents.</p>\n<p>The same Chinese statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on March 20 also declared, “China will uphold an objective and fair position on the Ukraine crisis and play a constructive role in promoting talks for peace,” essentially negating the narrative of an unjust war against Ukraine and portraying Xi’s visit to Moscow as any regular bilateral state visit.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>While the Chinese are no doubt constantly calculating the costs of Russia’s actions to themselves — they cannot have been too pleased with Putin’s visit to occupied Mariupol late on Saturday, for example — Xi sees value in showing the non-Western world that there is an alternative to American power and ideas of how the world should be run.</p>\n<p><strong>Does China want the war to end? Does it have influence on Putin enough to get him to stop?</strong></p>\n<p>Beijing is unlikely to want an end to the Russian war in Ukraine for several reasons.</p>\n<p>First, being tied down in Ukraine has the effect of weakening Russia militarily, economically, and politically. This is a vacuum that China can step into, especially in Eurasia — in September last year, for example, China offered security guarantees to Kazakhstan during Xi’s visit there, and made Belarus its second “all-weather strategic partner” after Pakistan.</p>\n<p>Second, a prolonged conflict in Ukraine means that the West’s, and in particular the United States’, attention and resources are diverted — and this the Chinese see as a good thing. From Beijing’s point of view, it weakens the focus on and reduces the resources for any potential Western intervention on China’s eastern seaboard, particularly in the scenario of a crisis over <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/explained-china-problem-nancy-pelosi-visit-taiwan-8066503/\">Taiwan</a>.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Third, a continuing crisis in Ukraine offers opportunities for international messaging about the relative rise in Chinese power vis-à-vis both the Russians and Americans. Clearly, Russia’s regional and global stature has taken a hit from what it has done and what it is unable to do — that is, to prosecute a quick end to the conflict.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, just as China’s role in helping Iran and Saudi Arabia restore diplomatic ties was intended to showcase Beijing’s rising influence and the decline of the US in the Middle Eastern region, the inability of the Ukrainians to expel the Russian invaders despite Western support can be used to send a signal in Europe.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-saudi-deal-what-the-gambit-can-mean-for-china-west-asia-and-india-8502096/\">Iran-Saudi deal: What the gambit can mean for China, West Asia, and India</a></div>\n<p>There is, therefore, little reason for Xi to try and persuade Putin to stop the war.</p>\n<p>If anything, China’s political support at forums such as the United Nations and elsewhere has been crucial to Russia building a case for the legitimacy of the war. We might even see over time indirect Chinese military support to Russia. The agreement between Belarus and China earlier this year has sections on industrial production, joint R&amp;D and defence cooperation — which could well allow for potential weapons production and transhipment to Russia.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p><strong>Are the US and China, too, in talks over the war?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that Washington and Beijing have a conversation ongoing about the conflict in Ukraine, but it is unlikely that they can come to any sort of meeting ground in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>The two nations have fundamentally different interests on this and other issues, and more often than not, these are opposing interests. These differences are ideological and deep-rooted, and the recent American shooting down of a Chinese surveillance balloon in US airspace suggests that tensions in the US-China relationship are only set to grow.</p>\n<p>Even if their interests were to align temporarily, Xi has too close a relationship with Putin — and sees greater value in a Russian bulwark against the West — to try and actively promote Washington’s brief. It is also not clear what the Americans could offer China in return.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the war affect China?</strong></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the war brings costs to China — not just economic ones but political ones, too, especially from the major Western nations that are also big markets for Chinese manufacturing and sources for high technology.</p>\n<p>But these are costs that the Chinese economy appears large enough to bear, especially when it is able to procure oil at deep discounts from Russia, and has had its own version of technological self-reliance programmes underway for decades. China is also able to use its economic influence to carry out trade in its own currency with Russia and other sanctioned regimes — Iran, for example.</p>\n<p>But the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on China is not just external and economic but also internal.</p>\n<p>The conflict confirms Xi’s claims in recent times in several important domestic documents and speeches that China “is facing global changes of a magnitude not seen in a century”. Calling attention to a challenging external environment is Xi’s way of reminding the Chinese people of the perils of “[v]arious ‘black swan’ and ‘gray rhino’ events” and the necessity of supporting the ruling Communist Party and Xi himself to help them deal with these challenges.</p>\n<p>An unstable external environment and its economic consequences can also be used to justify both China’s current economic difficulties in the wake of the pandemic as well as Xi’s continuing hold over the reins of power as being essential for national stability and recovery.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Jabin T Jacob is Associate Professor, Department of International Relations and Governance Studies, and Director, Centre for Himalayan Studies, Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR. </strong></em></p>\n</div> ",

It states, “A member may, with the permission of the Speaker, make a personal explanation although there is no question before the House, but in this case no debatable matter may be brought forward, and no debate shall arise.”</p>\n<p>In his request to the Lok Sabha Speaker, Rahul referred to the instance when former Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, in 2015, invoked rule 357 to respond to comments on him in Parliament by then-Congress leader and now Minister of Civil Aviation in the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/\">BJP</a>-led Central government, Jyotiraditya Scindia. Scindia had accused Prasad of demanding a parliamentary debate on the terms ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ mentioned in the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/the-preamble-what-does-it-say-and-what-does-it-mean-to-india-and-its-constitution-6232014/?fbclid=IwAR3S1eJ0ZQ7EUhxfMC5fJlO1U70PqRo-BMEJhu8n4Kl25Z3X_5KQ8TVA2C4\">preamble</a> to the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Rahul say in London?</strong></p>\n<p>On February 28, Rahul said at Cambridge University that “everybody knows…that Indian democracy is under…attack”, and “the institutional framework which is required for a democracy — Parliament, a free press, the judiciary, just the idea of mobilisation…, these are all getting constrained…”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Around a week later, during a discussion in Chatham House, he said: “It is an Indian problem and the solution is going to come from inside… However, the scale of Indian democracy means that [it] is a global public good… If Indian democracy collapses…democracy on the planet suffers a very serious, possibly fatal blow. So it is important for you too.”</p>\n<p><strong>How has the BJP responded?</strong></p>\n<p>The BJP has accused Rahul of making “denigrating, unwarranted comments” and spreading an “untenable narrative” about Indian institutions on foreign soil as part of a “calculated attempt” to bring them into disrepute.</p>\n<p>Last week, the party also approached the Lok Sabha Speaker, asking him to “set up a special committee of Lok Sabha to explore whether Congress leader <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/rahul-gandhi/\">Rahul Gandhi</a> should be suspended for allegedly insulting the country, its democracy, and Parliament”, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com\">The Indian Express</a> reported.</p>\n</div> ",

He argued that a convict whose life has to end because of the conviction and the sentence should not be compelled to suffer the pain of hanging.</p>\n<p>The plea in the PIL challenged the constitutional validity of Section 354(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973. This provision reads: “When any person is sentenced to death, the sentence shall direct that he be hanged by the neck till he is dead.”</p>\n<p>In the landmark 1982 ruling in ‘Bachan Singh v State of Punjab’, a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of the death sentence by a 4:1 majority ruling.</p>\n<p>The SC had agreed to hear the 2017 PIL, and had issued notice to the Centre. Court records show that in January 2018, the Centre filed an affidavit defending the current position of law, but the case had not been listed since then. CJI Chandrachud was one of the three judges along with then CJI Dipak Misra and Justice A M Khanwilkar (retd) who had agreed to hear the case.</p>\n<p>The case has now been listed after five years.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the Centre’s stand?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In its 2018 affidavit, the government had <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/hanging-most-suitable-mode-of-execution-centre-to-supreme-court-5150538/\"><strong>argued</strong></a> that death by hanging was the only “viable” option to execute a death warrant. However, the government also sought additional time to examine the methods followed in other countries.</p>\n<p>In its 187th report in 2003, the Law Commission of India recommended that Section 354(5) of the CrPC should be amended by providing an alternative mode of execution of death sentence by “lethal injection until the accused is dead”.</p>\n<p>The report suggested that it should be the discretion of the judge to pass appropriate orders regarding the mode of execution of death sentence and to hear the convict on the question of mode of execution of death sentence before passing the discretionary order.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the practice in other countries?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>According to Amnesty International, 55 countries around the world have the death sentence on the books. While death by hanging is still the most prevalent form of execution, especially in the former British colonies, other modes are followed in some countries.</p>\n<p>In the United States, for example, an intravenous lethal injection is given in every state (27 states and American Samoa) that allows the death penalty. Electrocution is a secondary method in some states. Execution by firing squad is employed in China, and Saudi Arabia uses beheading apart from other methods.</p>\n<p>In India, The Air Force Act, 1950, The Army Act 1950, and The Navy Act 1957 say that execution has to be carried out either by hanging by the neck until death or by being shot to death.</p>\n</div> ",

He has also put off holding local body elections citing the lack of funds, though opposition parties believe the postponement was due to Wickremesinghe’s lack of confidence that his side — which comprises the ousted Rajapakasas and their party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna — would able to win.</p>\n<p>The assurance from bilateral donors that they would support Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring was a precondition that Sri Lanka had to meet to unlock the arrangement with the IMF.

It is essentially a non-technical summary of the previous reports, which were released between 2018 and 2022, and sets out possible policies and measures that might help stave off the worst consequences of climate change.</p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaways from the report</strong></p>\n<p>The new report lays out the present impact of soaring global temperature and imminent ramifications in case the planet continues to get warmer.</p>\n<p>Due to the current global warming levels, almost every region across the planet is already experiencing climate extremes, an uptick in deaths due to heatwaves, reduced food and water security and damage to ecosystems, causing mass extinction of species on land and in the ocean.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Moreover, “vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to climate change are being disproportionately affected,” the report said. It added that more than three billion people live in areas that are “highly vulnerable” to climate change — people living in these regions were “15 times more likely to die from floods, droughts and storms between 2010-2020 than those living in regions with very low vulnerability”.</p>\n<p>Things can get worse if the world crosses the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature limit, a target agreed to in the Paris Agreement. This would result in an unpredictable global water cycle, drought and fires, devastating floods, extreme sea level events and more intense tropical cyclones.</p>\n<p>“We are already at approximately 1.1 degree Celsius over pre-industrial level temperatures. What it simply means is that any additional warming is going to have an adverse impact. So there are going to be losses and damages on different systems. In this report, we talk of loss and damages to biodiversity, livelihood, water security, energy security etc.,” Professor Joyashree Roy, one of the 93 authors of the Synthesis report, said.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>According to the scientists involved in writing the report, India would also face these dire consequences of global warming and needs to take immediate action to curb the temperature.</p>\n<p>Aditi Mukherjee, another author of the report, said, “Even though our per capita emissions are less, and we have historically, much less responsibility. But the reality is India is at the forefront of impacts. We simply cannot say that because we haven’t emitted much, we are not the ones to take action. I think the report makes it clear. Everybody has to take action according to their national context and circumstances urgently.”</p>\n<p>Given the present scale, scope and pace of global action, it’s most likely that Earth would overshoot this critical warming threshold somewhere in the following decade. The report categorically states that despite some advancements towards curtailing the greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, “adaptation gaps exist, and will continue to grow at current rates of implementation.” Some of the barriers to adaptation have been limited resources, lack of private sector and citizen engagement, low climate literacy, lack of political commitment and low sense of urgency.</p>\n<p>But there is still hope of arresting the rising global temperature within the 1.5 degree Celsius limit. In his address to the media, Guterres said, “Today’s <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/intergovernmental-panel-on-climate-change-report-global-warming-7795268/\"><strong>IPCC report</strong></a> is a how-to guide to defuse the climate time-bomb. It is a survival guide for humanity. As it shows, the 1.5-degree limit is achievable. But it will take a quantum leap in climate action. This report is a clarion call to massively fast-track climate efforts by every country and every sector and on every timeframe.”</p>\n<p>The Synthesis Report underlines the requirement of climate-resilient development, which is finding ways to adapt to climate change or reduce greenhouse gas emissions that provide wider benefits. It further mentions that to be effective, these measures must be rooted in our diverse values, world views and knowledge around the globe — including Indigenous knowledge.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Apart from highlighting the urgent need of limiting the use of fossil fuel, the report urges governments and policymakers to increase finance to climate investments, expand the clean energy infrastructure, reduce nitrogen pollution from agriculture, curtail food waste, adopt measures to make it easier for people to lead low-carbon lifestyles and much more.</p>\n<p>Madeleine Diouf Sarr, Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group, said, “We know what the solutions are. Renewables, storage, electrification – they are already gaining a place in many parts of the world. But not enough. We need to move faster, with rich countries leading the way.

NSA “empowers the state to detain a person without a formal charge and without trial”.</p>\n<p>Under the Act, a person is taken into custody to prevent them from acting in any manner prejudicial to “the security of the state” or for “maintenance of the public order”. It is an administrative order passed either by the Divisional Commissioner or the District Magistrate (DM) – and not detention ordered by police based on specific allegations or for a specific violation of the law.</p>\n<p>Even if a person is in police custody, the District Magistrate can slap NSA against them. Or, if a person has been granted bail by a trial court, they can be immediately detained under the NSA. If the person has been acquitted by the court, the same person can be detained under the NSA. The law takes away an individual’s constitutional right to be produced before the magistrate within 24 hours, as is the case when the accused is in police custody. The detained person also does not have the right to move a bail application before a criminal court.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What are the grounds for detention?</h2>\n<p>NSA can be invoked to prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India, relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India. Among others, it can also be applied to prevent a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supply and services essential to the community.</p>\n<p>An individual can be detained without a charge for a maximum period of 12 months. The detained person can be held for 10 to 12 days in special circumstances without being told the charges against them.</p>\n<h2>What is the protection available under the Act?</h2>\n<p>The Indian Constitution allows both preventive detention and the right of protection against arrest and detention in certain cases, enshrined under Article 22 of the Constitution. However, Article 22(3) provides that the rights available to an arrested person will not be applicable in case of preventive detention, thus an exception is carved out.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>One crucial procedural safeguard under the NSA is granted under Article 22(5), where all the detained persons have the right to make an effective representation before an independent advisory board, which consists of three members; and the board is chaired by a member who is, or has been, a judge of a high court. Notably, in a 2021 investigation of <em><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com\">The Indian Express</a></em> it was found that in all the 120 cases before the Allahabad High Court in the previous three years, the board upheld the detention.</p>\n<div><span>Express Investigation</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/detention-despite-bail-why-district-magistrates-love-the-nsa-7260430/\">Detention despite bail: Why District Magistrates love the NSA</a></div>\n<p>The DM who passes the detention order is protected under the Act: no prosecution or any legal proceeding can be initiated against the official who carries out the orders. Therefore, the writ of habeas corpus is the available remedy under the Constitution against the state’s power of taking people into custody under the NSA. Therefore, a <strong><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/produce-amritpal-singh-habeas-corpus-in-hc-8506884/\">habeas corpus petition has been filed in Singh’s case</a></strong> in Punjab and Haryana High Court by Imaan Singh Khara, the legal advisor of Waris Punjab De.</p>\n<h2>What the top court says</h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court in earlier cases had held that to prevent “misuse of this potentially dangerous power, the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed”, and “meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards” has to be ensured.</p>\n<h2>What is the criticism against NSA?</h2>\n<p>Nitin Kaushal, an advocate practising in the Punjab and Haryana High Court at <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/chandigarh/\">Chandigarh</a>, told<em> The Indian Express</em> that human rights groups have said in the past that the Act vitiates Article 22 of the Constitution and various provisions under the CrPC that safeguard the interest of an arrested person, namely that the arrested person should be informed regarding the ground of arrest and his right to consult a legal practitioner.</p>\n<p>Further, under the CrPC, the arrested person has to be produced before the nearest Magistrate within 24 hours, but the NSA carves out an exception. Some human rights groups argue that it is often misused by authorities to silence political opponents or those who are critical of the government. There have been calls for the Act to be repealed or amended to prevent its abuse.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>But there is an opposing view as well. Kaushal says the Act cannot be construed to be a draconian law as it protects the larger interest of the state, and is therefore likely to stay.</p>\n</div> ",

Though the accused(s) completed around 4-5 years of their sentences in the CBI case, Special Judge Ashwani Kumar Sarpal, who was hearing the case, said the court was “helpless”.</p><div><span>Also Read in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/kerala-high-court-a-raja-election-null-void-dalit-christian-8508351/\">Kerala HC declares A Raja’s election null and void: Can Christians, Muslims claim SC status?</a></div>\n<p>In doing so, the court rejected the accused’s argument alleging double jeopardy and said that “to operate as a bar of double jeopardy, the second prosecution and consequential punishment must be for the same offense”. If the two offences are distinct then the ban under Section 300 CrPC cannot be invoked, the court stated, while distinguishing between the 2012 CBI case involving “cheating, misappropriation and the criminal misconduct of the public servant while discharging official duty” from the ED’s 2021 money laundering case.</p>\n<h2>What is double jeopardy?</h2>\n<p>“Double jeopardy” comes from the Latin maxim “Nemo bis punitur pro eodem delicto”, which means that no one can be tried for the same offence twice. It has existed since the days of the Greeks and Romans, even finding a mention in the Justinian code, Canon law, Common Law, and the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>In India, this doctrine existed even before the Constitution came into being. A case in point would be the now-repealed General Clauses Act, of 1897 and Section 300 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1973, which says that a person once convicted or acquitted cannot be tried for the same offence. In its 2022 ruling in ‘T.P. Gopalakrishnan vs. State of Kerala,’ the Supreme Court went so far as to say that Section 300 bars the trial of a person not just for the same offence but also for any other offence on the same facts.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/vienna-convention-high-commission-london-8508253/\">Vandalism by pro-Khalistan protestors at Indian High Commission in London: What is the Vienna Convention, invoked by MEA</a></div>\n<p>The doctrine of double jeopardy is enshrined in the Indian Constitution under Article 20 (2), which says, “No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.” It guarantees immunity from double punishment and bars a second prosecution only where the accused has been both prosecuted and punished for the same offence previously, as held by the Supreme Court in its 1954 ruling in ‘Venkataraman SA vs. Union of India’.</p>\n<p>However, in its 1996 ruling in ‘AA Mulla vs State of Maharashtra’, the apex court held that Article 20(2) does not bar subsequent trials if the ingredients of the offences in the previous and subsequent trials are distinct. Moreover, there are certain conditions for the application of Article 20 (2).</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What are the conditions for the application of Article 20(2)?</h2>\n<p>It states:</p>\n<p>1) There must have been previous proceedings before a court of law or a judicial tribunal of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>2) The person must have been prosecuted in the previous proceedings.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>3) The conviction or acquittal in the previous proceeding must be in force at the time of the second trial.</p>\n<p>4) The offence which is a subject matter of the second proceeding must be the same as that of the first proceeding for which the accused was prosecuted and punished.</p>\n<p>5) The “offence” must be an offence as defined in Section 3(38) of the General Clauses Act which defines it as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force. The prosecution must also be valid and not null, void, or abortive.</p>\n<p>6) The subsequent proceeding must be a fresh proceeding where an accused is being prosecuted for the same offence twice. Hence, this clause does not apply when the later proceedings are a continuation of the previous proceedings, nor does it bar a retrial on appeal with a direction to frame charges, provided the retrial is for the same offence or offence as the original trial.</p>\n<h2>Why did the court allow ED’s case after 11 years?</h2>\n<p>The Prevention of Money Laundering Act does not provide for a limitation period for money laundering. This indicates that the law laid down in Section 468 of the CrPC, which states that there is no limitation period for offences punishable with three years imprisonment or more, will apply.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>In this case, the court observed that the accused were nearing the completion of their sentence when the “ED suddenly filed the present complaint under the PMLA Act” on March 30, 2021, for the commission of offences under Section 4 read with Section 3. The former deals with punishment for money laundering, stipulating a minimum of three years imprisonment, while the latter defines “money laundering”.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/in-orop-case-cji-refuses-to-accept-sealed-cover-why-did-he-do-so-8508451/\">In OROP case, CJI Chandrachud refuses to accept ‘sealed cover’: Why did he do so?</a></div>\n<p>That the ED registered its Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) on December 17, 2009, and took about 11 years to file the complaint in court was also observed by the court and contested by the accused. “No explanation has been given in the complaint by the ED why it took several years to file the same in the court. No doubt, there is no limitation period for filing the complaint in the court by the ED under PMLA Act but certainly, in the present situation, it can be said that the ED slept over the matter for several years and suddenly come to the court to harass the accused persons and to upset their settled lives and has caused some prejudice to them,” the court observed.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>While the accused pleaded for leniency on grounds of double jeopardy and delay in ED filing the complaint, the court said that the wording of Section 4 of the PMLA Act seeks mandatory rigorous punishment of at least three years and the accused can’t be given the benefit of Probation of Offenders Act.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>The court also acknowledged the possibility of imposing a concurrent sentence, had the ED filed its complaint during the pendency of the CBI case.

          "description": "",
          "content": "<div class=\"ev-meter-content\" morss_own_score=\"3.3780160857908843\" morss_score=\"54.87801608579088\"><p><em><strong>By Richard Lough</strong></em></p>\n<p>President Emmanuel Macron faces the toughest challenge to his authority after his government bypassed the lower house to push through a deeply unpopular pension reform bill that will raise the retirement age. Here is why.</p><div><span>Explained </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/why-garbage-is-piling-up-in-the-streets-of-france-8498519/\">More than 7,000 tonnes of garbage piling up on Paris streets: What’s happening in France?</a></div>\n<h2>What changes to the pension system does Macron want to make?</h2>\n<p>The legislation raises the retirement age by two years to 64. The change will be implemented gradually, with the age increased by three months each year starting from this September, until 2030. Some workers in jobs deemed physically or mentally arduous will maintain the right to retire earlier than most of the working population.</p>\n\n<p>From 2027, most workers will have to make social security contributions over 43 years rather than 42 years in order to draw a full pension. This was already foreseen in a 2014 reform but Macron is accelerating the pace of transition.</p>\n<p>\nIn comparison, the United States is slowly raising its retirement age to 67, while Britain has announced plans to raise the state pension age to 68 by somewhere between 2037 and 2039.</p><h2>Why does the government say change is needed?</h2>\n<p>Macron’s government says reform is necessary to keep the pension budget in the black. Failure to act would see the pension system record an annual deficit of 13.5 billion euros by 2030, the government forecasts.</p>\n<p>The principal measures were initially seen generating 17.7 billion euros in additional contributions by 2030. The government calculated that “accompanying measures” to smooth the way would cost 4.8 billion euros, creating a 0.3 billion euros surplus in 2030.</p>\n<p>However, additional sweeteners raised this cost to 6 billion euros, leaving the government to find further last-minute savings and extra contributions to balance the budget. France’s pension system costs nearly 14% of GDP, the third highest within the OECD behind Italy and Greece.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>Why is pension reform such a delicate task in France?</h2>\n<p>The pension system is a cornerstone of France’s cherished model of social protection. It is founded upon an obligatory contributory pension scheme and upon solidarity between generations. In other words, the contributions of those who are currently working directly fund the pensions of those now in retirement.</p>\n<p>Individuals can make voluntary contributions into savings products to top-up their eventual pension through the state-run system, but private pension funds like those common in Britain and the United States do not exist.</p>\n<div><span>Explained Global </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/turmoil-in-israel-8478880/\">Turmoil in Israel: Pushback in the streets as Netanyahu targets judiciary</a></div>\n<p>Past presidents including Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac met similarly fierce resistance from trade unions and on the street when seeking to change the pension system.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n<p>Macron’s decision to ram through the pension legislation without a vote has infuriated opponents and triggered pockets of violent unrest.</p>\n<p>The government faces a vote of no-confidence in parliament. The motion is expected to fail, leaving the government to fight another day, while trade unions promise to keep up their battle. If unexpectedly the no-confidence vote is passed, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne would tender her government’s resignation in the hours that followed.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>Macron would have to form a new government with no working majority in parliament and remain reliant on a deeply divided mainstream centre-right for support. He could call a referendum on the pension reform and risk it becoming a plebiscite during his presidency. Or he could dissolve parliament and call snap elections, a move observers predict would only weaken him further in the National Assembly.</p>\n</div> ",

Chinese officials have framed the meeting partly as a mission to promote constructive talks between Russia and Ukraine, even though US officials have been skeptical of Xi’s recent efforts to become a global peacemaker.</p>\n<p>Here are five things to know about the relationship between China and Russia:</p>\n<h2><b>Are China and Russia allies?</b></h2>\n<p>China and Russia are not formal allies, meaning they have not committed to defend each other with military support. But the two countries are close strategic partners, a relationship that deepened during the war in Ukraine as Russia became increasingly isolated from many other countries.</p>\n<p>Chinese officials have said the current relationship is at a “historic high.”</p>\n<div><span>Also in Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/iran-saudi-deal-what-the-gambit-can-mean-for-china-west-asia-and-india-8502096/\">Iran-Saudi deal: What the gambit can mean for China, West Asia, and India</a></div>\n<p>The partnership is fueled by a shared goal of trying to weaken U.S. power and influence.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The relationship between China and Russia has not always been so warm. The two sides were fierce adversaries in the 1960s and clashed in 1969 over disputed territory along their border, raising fears at the time of a nuclear showdown between the two countries.</p>\n<p>The two countries have also been competing for influence in Central Asia, a region the Kremlin has long seen as its turf but is becoming increasingly important to China’s geopolitical and economic ambitions. China is building more railroads, highways and energy pipelines in former Soviet republics such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which still rely on Russia as a crucial security partner.</p>\n<h2><b>How close are Xi and Putin?</b></h2>\n<p>Right before the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022, Xi and Putin declared publicly that their countries’ relationship had “no limits.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Xi has often described Putin as his best friend. During an economic forum in Russia in 2018, the two fried Russian pancakes and took vodka shots together. For Xi’s 66th birthday in 2019, Putin presented him with a cake and a giant box of ice cream.</p>\n<p>In an article published in a Chinese newspaper Sunday, Putin said the two enjoyed the “warmest relationship,” noting that they have met about 40 times in recent years and always found time to talk at “no‑tie” events.</p>\n<h2><b>What is the economic relationship between Russia and China?</b></h2>\n<p>Economic ties between China and Russia have strengthened significantly since Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, when it annexed Crimea. At the time, China helped Russia evade the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration that were supposed to cut off Russia’s access to global markets.</p>\n<p>In the wake of harsher sanctions against Russia following the start of the Ukraine war last year, China has helped to supply many of the products that Russia previously purchased from Western-allied countries, including computer chips, smartphones and raw materials needed for military equipment.</p>\n<p>Total trade between Russia and China surged last year.</p>\n<div><span>Explained</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/turmoil-in-israel-8478880/\">Turmoil in Israel: Pushback in the streets as Netanyahu targets judiciary</a></div>\n<h2><b>What does Putin want from China?</b></h2>\n<p>Putin needs China to help bolster his economy, which has been battered by Western sanctions. For the Russian leader, China has increasingly become a lifeline for investment and trade. After Western countries restricted their purchases of Russian crude oil and natural gas last year, China helped offset the decline by buying more energy from Russia.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>At the start of the Ukraine war, Russia asked China for military equipment and economic assistance, according to U.S. officials. U.S. officials have recently said that China is considering giving weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine, a claim that China has denied.</p>\n<p>China has refrained from condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, even though China’s foreign policy is rooted around the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Although China has portrayed itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war, it has endorsed Russian narratives, blaming the U.S. and <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-nato-why-is-russia-so-insecure-about-ukraine-joining-us-led-alliance-7805037/\">NATO</a> for starting the conflict.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>But China has also hesitated to put its full backing behind Russia. The turmoil and instability stemming from the war could threaten China’s growth and complicate its efforts to strengthen its economic ties around the world.</p>\n<p>Last September, after Putin and Xi met in person, Putin acknowledged that China had expressed “questions and concerns” about the war in Ukraine.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<h2><b>What does Xi want from Russia?</b></h2>\n<p>Xi wants Putin to join him as a like-minded ally in confronting U.S. and Western dominance.</p>\n<p>In an article published in a Russian newspaper Monday before the visit, Xi said China and Russia needed to cooperate to overcome challenges to their security, including “damaging acts of hegemony, domination and bullying.”</p>\n<p>Xi has pursued a harder stance against what he calls a U.S. effort to contain China’s rise, portraying China as a nation besieged — much as Putin has done in speeches to Russians. Xi has urged Chinese industries to reduce their reliance on Western technology and hailed China’s growth as proof that it does not need to adopt Western political values.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>China has been buying more advanced weapons from Russia to modernize its military, and the two nations have increased their joint military exercises. Last year, as President Joe Biden was visiting Tokyo, China and Russia sent bombers over the seas in northeast Asia as a show of force.</p>\n</div>\n",

The transaction will bring benefits to clients and create long-term sustainable value for our investors.”</p>\n<h2><strong>History of UBS bank</strong></h2>\n<p>Known for providing private banking, wealth management, asset management, and investment banking services for private, corporate and institutional clients, UBS was established in 1998 when two of Switzerland’s biggest banks, the Swiss Bank Corporation and the Union Bank of Switzerland, were joined together. Notably, the name UBS, although it has been derived from “Union Bank of Switzerland”, isn’t an acronym.</p>\n<p>The Swiss Bank Corporation was originally set up as Basel Bank Corporation in 1854 by six private bankers in Basel in order to provide credit to Swiss railroad and manufacturing companies. In subsequent years, it merged with Zürich Bank Corporation and entered the commercial banking sector. By 1897, the Basel Bank Corporation had consumed two other Swiss banks and changed its name to Swiss Bank Corporation. It went on to acquire several more banks in the following years, opening its branches across Switzerland and other countries.</p>\n<p>The Union Bank of Switzerland opened up in 1912 after the Bank in Winterthur (1862) was merged with Toggenburger Bank (1863). Much like the Swiss Bank Corporation, the Union Bank of Switzerland also absorbed a host of banks in Switzerland and became one of the biggest banks in the country.</p>\n<p>Despite the success of both the Swiss Bank Corporation and the Union Bank of Switzerland, they were merged together as they faced intense competition from American banks. Thus, in 1998, UBS Group AG or UBS was born.</p><div>Also Read</div><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Today, it is one of the largest banks in the world with a market capitalization of $63 billion, as per a 2022 report. With its headquarter in Zurich, UBS has around 200 branches and 4,600 client advisors in Switzerland alone. It also provides its services in 50 other countries, including India.</p>\n</div> ",

He had expressed similar views earlier too, as had former CJI N V Ramana.</p>\n<p><strong>What is “sealed cover jurisprudence”?</strong></p>\n<p>It is the practice of seeking and accepting information from government agencies in sealed envelopes that can only be perused by judges. It has been followed by the Supreme Court in the past, and sometimes lower courts as well.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p><strong>Under what circumstances does the court seek information in a sealed cover?</strong></p>\n<p>This can happen in broadly two kinds of cases: (i) when the information is connected to an ongoing investigation and, (ii) when the information is personal or confidential in nature.</p>\n<p>It is understood that in the first situation, an ongoing investigation could be impeded by the disclosure, and in the second situation, an individual’s privacy could be affected or there may be a breach of trust.</p>\n<p><strong>So what is the problem then?</strong></p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The secrecy could end up preventing a party from having a full overview of the charges against them.

The disclosure of relevant material to the adjudicating authority in a sealed cover makes the process of adjudication vague and opaque”.</p>\n<p>This, the court said, “perpetuates two problems”:</p>\n<p>“Firstly, it denies the aggrieved party their legal right to effectively challenge an order since the adjudication of issues has proceeded on the basis of unshared material provided in a sealed cover…</p>\n<p>“Secondly, it perpetuates a culture of opaqueness and secrecy. It bestows absolute power in the hands of the adjudicating authority. It also tilts the balance of power in a litigation in favour of a dominant party which has control over information. Most often than not this is the state. A judicial order accompanied by reasons is the hallmark of the justice system… The sealed cover procedure affects the functioning of the justice delivery system both at an individual case- to case level and at an institutional level.”</p>\n<p><strong>But surely not all information can be circulated indiscriminately?</strong></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court in its judgment clarified that “this is not to say that all information must be disclosed in the public”. It gave the example of “sensitive information affecting the privacy of individuals such as the identity of a sexual harassment victim”.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read </span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-compassionate-appointment-ruling-8492120/\">Supreme Court rejects applications for ‘compassionate appointment’: What the court has ruled</a></div>\n<p>But it also underlined that “the measure of nondisclosure of sensitive information in exceptional circumstances must be proportionate to the purpose that the non-disclosure seeks to serve”, and that “the exceptions should not…become the norm”.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the position taken by the CJI something new?</strong></p>\n<p>Not really. The court has expressed this view even before this week, last month, and in October last year. Some examples:</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>* In March 2022, in a case involving the Bihar government, a three-judge Bench headed by then CJI Ramana insisted that all arguments should be made in open court. “Please don’t give us a sealed cover, we don’t want it here,” the then CJI had told counsel for Patna High Court.</p>\n<p>* Later that same day, Justice Chandrachud, during the hearing on an appeal against the Centre’s ban on the Malayalam TV channel MediaOne, said, “We are averse to sealed cover jurisprudence.

But the SC declined to allow the same practice, and subsequently stayed the ban.</p>\n<p>* In December 2019, while granting bail to former Minister P Chidambaram in the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/chidambaram-inx-media-scam-case-explained-karti-5921402/\">INX media case</a>, a Supreme Court Bench of Justices R Banumathi, A S Bopanna, and Hrishikesh Roy censured the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/\">Delhi</a> High Court for relying on material submitted by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a sealed cover.</p>\n<p>“It would be against the concept of fair trial if in every case the prosecution presents documents in sealed cover and the findings on the same are recorded as if the offence is committed and the same is treated as having a bearing for denial or grant of bail,” the Bench said.</p>\n<p><strong>So how did the use of sealed covers become common?</strong></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has itself encouraged the practice of seeking public interest-related information in sealed envelopes, most recently under former CJI and now <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/parliament-monsoon-session-live-updates-rajya-sabha-lok-sabha-8035871/\">Rajya Sabha</a> member Justice <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/ranjan-gogoi/\">Ranjan Gogoi</a>.</p>\n<p>* In the Rafale aircraft case, the court accepted the government’s argument that the matter pertained to the Official Secrets Act.</p>\n<p>* While refusing to stay the arrest of activists held in the Bhima-<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-was-the-battle-of-koregaon-mahar-dalit-marathas-maharashtra-bandh-5009488/\">Koregaon</a> case, it relied on “evidence” submitted by the Maharashtra police in a sealed envelope.</p>\n<p>* In the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/\">NRC</a> exercise in Assam — which led to about 19 lakh citizens being excluded from the list — the apex court sought details from the NRC coordinator in a sealed cover with neither the government nor the affected parties being allowed to look at them.</p>\n<p>* In the case involving corruption allegations against former CBI director Alok Verma, the court insisted that the Central Vigilance Commission submit its report in a sealed cover, ostensibly to maintain public confidence in the agency.</p>\n<p>* In the 2G case, in which it had cancelled a large number of licences, the court had relied on sealed covers.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>* During the hearing in the Chidambaram case, while trying to persuade the court to refer to information in the sealed cover, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had referred to a case from 1997, involving P V Prabhakar Rao, the son of former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao.</p>\n</div> ",

The plea alleged that Raja was a baptized Christian who cannot belong to the SC community after he changed his religion. Over the years, the judiciary and the legislature have examined the question of whether the SC status can extend to Muslim and Christian Dalits.</p><h2>What is the Centre’s stand?</h2>\n<p>In November 2022, when the Apex Court considered this issue in ‘Centre for Public Interest Litigation and Another vs Union of India’, the Central government submitted that the Constitution (Scheduled Caste) Order, 1950 challenged in the present case was based on historical data which established that “no backwardness or oppression was ever faced by members of Christian or Islamic Society.”</p>\n<p>The affidavit filed by the Centre added that the reason why Dalits convert to Islam or Christianity is to come out of the oppressive system of untouchability in Hinduism, which is not prevalent in either of the two religions.</p>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/no-reservation-needed-for-dalit-christians-muslims-sangh-wing-8482876/\">No reservation needed for Dalit Christians, Muslims: Sangh wing</a></div>\n<p>The Centre also quoted a dissenting note from the National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities report stating that Islam and Christianity are foreign religions that do not recognise the caste system. Conferring SC status on converts will amount to introducing the caste system in those religions, the report said.</p>\n<p>Before this, on October 7, 2022, the Centre had established a three-member commission, headed by former CJI KG Balakrishnan, to examine the grant of SC status to persons who claimed to historically belong to the scheduled castes but had subsequently converted to religions other than the ones mentioned in the Presidential Orders issued under Article 341 of the Constitution. The Commission is scheduled to submit its report in 2024, while the question of reservations for Muslim &amp; Christian Dalits remains unanswered before the Apex Court.</p>\n<h2>What is the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950?</h2>\n<p>In 1950, when the Constitution was being framed, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, was issued under Article 341 of the Constitution which says that the President may for any State or UT publicly notify and specify the “castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within castes, races or tribes, which shall for the purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Caste.”</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also Read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/reservations-dalit-christians-muslims-8160523/\">On reservations for Dalit Christians and Muslims, a question of government’s intent</a></div>\n<p>The original order was passed in 1950 and allowed only Hindus to be classified as SCs. However, it was later amended to include Sikhs in 1956, and Buddhists in 1990, in the wake of political pressure. Despite these amendments, no provisions were made to include backward communities within Christians and Muslims under the definition of SCs.</p>\n<h2>The two reports under the UPA Government</h2>\n<p>In October 2004, the UPA government headed by Dr <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/about/manmohan-singh/\">Manmohan Singh</a> established the National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities, headed by erstwhile CJI Justice Ranganath Misra, to recommend measures for the welfare of socially and economically backward sections among religious and linguistic minorities.</p>\n<p>Three years later, in May 2007, the Ranganath Misra Commission submitted its report, recommending a complete delinking of religion from the classification of Scheduled Castes. The Commission also recommended that reservations be made religion-neutral and that socio-economic criteria should be the basis for such a classification. However, Parliament rejected these recommendations on account of inadequate field data.</p><div>Also Read</div><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>To resolve this ambiguity, the UPA government constituted the Sachar Committee in 2005 to examine the social and economic conditions of Indian Muslims. In 2006, the Committee came out with its report that observed the situation of Dalit Muslims to not improve even after conversion. The report placed Muslims below SCs and STs in backwardness. Among the many issues highlighted was the mismatch between the percentage of Muslims in the population and in decision-making positions such as the IAS and IPS.</p>\n</div> ",

India’s private non-financial sector debt has witnessed a steady decline since mid-2021, along with an improvement in the quality of debt. India’s corporate sector credit-GDP ratio is also below its historical trend, implying sufficient space for the corporate sector to borrow further. The strong debt profile portrayed by corporates will prove to be critical in maintaining the macroeconomic stability of the economy going forward,” it said.</p>\n<div><span>Also read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/audio/3-things/credit-suisse-gets-sold-foreign-lawyers-in-india-and-stalling-parliament/8508959/\">Credit Suisse gets sold, foreign lawyers in India, and stalling Parliament</a></div>\n<p>The tightening of monetary policy tends to create new vulnerabilities in economies where debt levels are low and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities where debt is already high, precipitating significant disruptions to the functioning of the financial system, it said. Citing data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the ministry said the core debt of the corporate sector increased in both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs), reaching 175 per cent of GDP in EMEs and 185 per cent of GDP in AEs at the end of 2020, adding that India is amongst a small set of countries that have been able to reduce their debt burden from Q3 2008 to Q3 2022. “This is a result of the banking sector’s balance sheet clean-up and the corporate sector’s deleveraging exercise undertaken over the last decade. India’s relatively lower debt burdens will help limit the impact of financial contagion that may arise as rising borrowing costs trigger debt sustainability concerns,” it said.</p>\n<p>In India, despite the Swiss regulators’ intervention to protect the global financial system, investor sentiment remained shaky with the benchmark Sensex falling over 900 points at one stage before closing 0.62 per cent, or 361 points, down at 57,628.95 and the NSE Nifty Index falling 112 points at 16,988.40 on Monday.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<div><span>Also read</span> |<a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/credit-suisse-shares-slump-over-61-in-premarket-trading-after-ubs-deal-8507693/\">Bank shares plummet as Credit Suisse rescue fails to quell contagion fears</a></div>\n<p>The fear of contagion continued to roil the global financial sector and stock markets on Monday even after Swiss bank UBS agreed to buy its banking rival Credit Suisse in a $3.25 billion takeover over the weekend. The pessimist mood prevailing across the global markets triggered a major sell-off in global markets, including India, as investors are still battling a slew of negative news from turmoil in large global banks to macro-economic concerns and falling commodity prices.</p>\n<p>The Indian stock markets have now plummeted 9.36 per cent with the Sensex plunging from the 52-week high of 63,583.07 recorded on December 1, 2022</p>\n<p>Global markets, including India, are now awaiting the outcome of the US <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-fed-and-what-role-does-it-play-us-economy-7824639/\">Federal Reserve</a> meeting to see how they will respond to the ongoing crisis, particularly in terms of rate hikes.

After UBS announced its takeover deal, the <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/what-is-fed-and-what-role-does-it-play-us-economy-7824639/\">Fed</a> joined with other central banks in a joint liquidity operation.

What has unnerved investors and depositors is the parlous banking situation with many US banks potentially at risk of a run.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Amid the ongoing US banking crisis, the Indian banking system continues to remain resilient and stable, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said last week. “We have been engaging with the banks over the last several years and I am happy to report that the way the Indian banking system has evolved and the way it is positioned today, the Indian banking system continues to be resilient and stable,” Das said</p>\n<p>He, however, cautioned lenders against build-up of any asset-liability mismanagement and asked them to keep conducting internal stress tests to ensure proper risk assessment.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>The proposed takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS – both Swiss banks – is expected to witness consolidation of the Indian operations of both the banks. While UBS and Credit Suisse are present in India in the investment banking and wealth management areas, the latter has a banking licence with just one branch operating in <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/\">Mumbai</a>.</p>\n<p>UBS Securities India Pvt Ltd is a Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) registered stock broker and holds membership on the NSE and the BSE. UBS provides corporate, institutional and wealth management clients with expert advice, innovative solutions, execution and comprehensive access to international capital markets in India. India is one of the technology hubs of UBS with a sizeable workforce.</p><div>Advertisement</div>\n<p>Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, incorporated in December 1996, is involved in activities auxiliary to financial intermediation, except insurance and pension funding. It already offers wealth management, investment banking and asset management in India, serving high net worth, corporate and institutional clients.</p>\n<p>These two firms are likely to be integrated as the global merger process takes shape in the coming months. Neelkanth Mishra, Co-head of Asia-Pacific strategy of Credit Suisse Securities, recently decided to step down from his role and move to head the research wing at Axis Bank.</p>\n<p>As many as 45 foreign banks are present in India, but they have a relatively smaller presence in India with 6 per cent share in total assets, 4 per cent in loans and 5 per cent in deposits. They are more active in the derivative markets (forex and interest rates) where they have 50 per cent share. Most of them are present as branches of the parent bank with only a few present as a wholly-owned subsidiary.</p><div>Also Read</div>\n<p>Nevertheless, they retain capital, liquidity and make similar annual report disclosures as Indian banks, it said. Top five foreign banks in India by assets are HSBC, Citibank (it has now sold its consumer business to Axis), Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan Chase which is also the largest US bank.</p>\n</div> ",

Both are two major direct instruments of the RBI’s monetary policy as well. They are designed to meet different purposes. The CRR is aimed to control the credit creating capacity of the banks by instructing them to keep certain proportion of the deposits as reserves with the RBI. This means that that reserves cannot be given as loan and that much money is not circulated in the economy. The SLR on the other hand, requires banks to deploy a certain proportion of their deposits in liquid assets like government securities. The objective of SLR is to ensure that all the funds are not loaned out to the public. If the banks are deploying a certain proportion of their deposits in liquid assets, it may help them to convert into cash in emergency time.</p>\n<p><strong>What is CRR?</strong></p>\n<p>The cash reserve ratio is the proportion of demand and time deposits (Net Demand and Time Liabilities) that every scheduled commercial bank has to keep with the RBI as cash reserves.</p>\n<p><strong>What is SLR? </strong></p>\n<p>Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) is a requirement that commercial banks have to keep a certain proportion of their demand and time deposits as liquid assets in their vault.  In the context of SLR, liquid assets mean assets in the form of cash, gold and approved securities (government securities).</p>\n<p>Both are ratios that are expressed as a percentage of the bank’s deposits. The CRR and SLR are to be kept by the scheduled banks in India as well as local area banks which are non-scheduled banks. A Crucial difference is that while CRR is to be kept with the RBI, the SLR is to be kept with the concerned banks’ vault. The difference between the CRR and the SLR are given below.</p>\n<p>Table: Difference between CRR and SLR</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>CRR</strong></td>\n<td><strong>SLR</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>What is?</td>\n<td>The percentage of total deposits (Net Demand and Time Liabilities or NDTL) that banks are required to hold as cash reserves with the RBI.\n<p>CRR should be kept on a daily basis.</p></td>\n<td>The percentage of total deposits (demand and time deposits) that banks are required to hold in the form of liquid assets such as government securities.

The CRR is a percentage of total deposits that banks must hold as cash with the central bank, while the SLR is a percentage of total deposits that banks must hold as liquid assets such as government securities. The CRR is used to control the money supply in the economy and regulate inflation, while the SLR is used to ensure liquidity of banks. The liquid assets under SLR may give the bank an opportunity to covert the liquid assets into cash through the emergency liquidity window called Marginal Standing Facility.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.indianeconomy.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CRR-vs-SLR.png\"></p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n",

The seller doesn’t own the shares he is selling, rather, these shares are automatically borrowed from another owner. The logic of short selling is that the seller expects the value of this share to decline in near future ( in the same day) and he buys the share later to complete the transaction. Short selling is an intra-day transaction mostly.</p>\n<p>Understand that the seller doesn’t owned the share and hence he has to return the share by buying later from the market and thus automatically returning. Under short selling, the investor actually is assumed to be borrowing the shares from the market.</p>\n<p><strong>How can a trader sell a share without buying it?</strong></p>\n<p>The doubt for any individual is how a trader can sell shares when he has not bought them. Here, understand that such a facility is allowed in the stock market by the regulators. Individuals and institutions can sell the share they are not owned but there is an important condition that he should buy the shares later in the day to complete the transaction.</p>\n<p>The borrowing and later returning part are not directly involved by the trader. He has to just sell first and buy later to fulfil his deal (need not bother about borrowing and later returning scenarios and this will be automatically done through the market mechanism). Retail investors and institutional investors like Hindenburg can also make short selling.</p>\n<p>This facility of short selling is allowed by the regulators to impart more volume and liquidity in the market or to enhance stock market activity. Usually short selling happens in a bearish markets when there is scope for heavy drop in the share price in immediate future.</p>\n<p>The normal trading pattern in the market is we are buying a particular share, expecting that its price will go up in the future. Then we will be selling the shares we bought and will be making good profit. This is the normal investment pattern. The opposite is short selling. Short selling is an unorthodox type of speculative deal in the sense that we are mainly used to buying first and selling later.</p>\n<p>Following explains short selling process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The trader expects a fall in the share of a company.</li>\n<li>He sells (doesn’t bought the share so far – this is very important and it is assumed that he is borrowing the share from the market to sell) the shares for Rs 50.</li>\n<li>Later the shares’ price falls to Rs 30 and then he buys the share to complete the transaction.</li>\n<li>Here, the trader’s profit is Rs 20.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The mindset of the short seller is that he expects that the price of the share he is selling is going to fall soon. Here, regulators allow traders to sell first (short selling) and buy later to complete the transaction. Speculation is the main motive behind short selling. Several investors also short-sell for hedging ( to insure an opposite transaction of buying (or long position) the shares) purposes. Remember in the stock market terminology, a long position indicates buying transaction whereas a short position denotes a selling transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens when the investor doesn’t buy (to complete the transaction) later?</strong></p>\n<p morss_own_score=\"7.0\" morss_score=\"9.0\">Here, automatically, the transaction will be automatically <em>squared off </em>at a particular time (in the NSE, it is 3.20 pm) towards the end of the trading day and the automatic buying price will be the price prevailing at that time (3,.20 pm in the NSE).</p>\n<p><strong>Advantages and disadvantages of short selling</strong></p>\n<p>The advantages and disadvantages of short selling is like the two sides of a coin. You can make big profit through short selling. At the same time, the disadvantage is that you can make big losses as well.</p>\n<p>****<img src=\"https://www.indianeconomy.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Short-selling.png\">*****</p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Apatanis principally use three rice varieties: Emeo, Pyape and Mypia.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/vale-of-apatanis-56032\">Vale of Apatanis</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The total area of the Apatani Plateau is 10,135 square kilometres, where rice-fish culture is undertaken approximately in 592.0 hectares (ha) of irrigated rice lands out of 715.7 ha.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau is a land of diverse cultures. The major festivals of Apatanis are the Myoko, Dree, Yapung and Murung. People here believe that these traditional festivals ensure better productivity and well-being.</p>\n<p>Apatani Plateau has a climate ranging from humid subtropical to temperate. So, this plateau receives adequate rainfall during the summer season. The permeability and water-retaining capacity of the clayey, loamy soil favour this unique farming technique.</p>\n<p>This integrated rice-fish cultivation is a low-input and eco-friendly practice. The stocked fish practically depend on the natural food sources of the rice fields and thus, farmers hardly need to use any supplementary fish feeds.</p>\n<p>The farmers sometimes use household and agricultural wastes and excreta of domestic animals like pigs, cows, mithun (<em>Bos frontalis</em>) and goats to make farming more sustainable and organic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, azolla and lemna are also grown in the field water as nitrogen fixers. The organic food grown in the field plays an essential role in feeding fish.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/agriculture/downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/recognise-empower-indigenous-land-tenure-and-title-to-achieve-sdgs-holistically-un-report-75997\">Recognise, empower indigenous land tenure and title to achieve SDGs holistically: UN Report</a></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The water sources in these high-altitude rice fields are mountain streams and rainwater trickled down during the monsoon season.</p>\n<p>Bamboo pipes are being used to distribute water from the networks of earthen irrigation channels using two outlet pipes. An outlet is fitted angularly at the upper level through a dyke to maintain the water level and another outlet is fitted at the bottom of the dyke to the exterior. It is used for dewatering the field during harvest.</p>\n<p>Men and women perform different farm duties while preparing the fields for cultivating rice. And during the culture of fish, women folk participate as the major workforce.</p>\n<p>Ancient and old-fashioned agricultural technologies are utilised for cultivation. Modern tools like tractors and power tillers are not affordable as well as inaccessible to the farmers.</p>\n<p>They mostly use agricultural tools such as <em>Dao</em> (sickle) and dibbling sticks. After preparing the field, they transplant a maximum of two-three healthy rice plants with an average distance of 26 cm from each other.</p>\n<p><span>Fish refuges are also created inside the fields. Three strains of fish species of common carp — </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiospecularis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpio communis</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpionudus — </span></em><span>are stocked just after ten days from transplanting rice.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><span>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/sustainable-rice-production-key-to-food-security-57492\">Sustainable rice production key to food security</a></span></strong></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>The stocked fish are harvested twice in a season. The first and second or final harvest is done in the middle of July and October, respectively. But the rice is harvested at the end of September until the mid of October, i.e. once in a season.</span></p>\n<p><span>Four cultivars of rice are grown along with fish species of </span><em><span>Cyprinus carpiol</span></em><span>. The total productivity ranges from 300-500 kilograms of fish per hectare in one season (ha-1 season-1) and 3,000-4,000 kg of rice (ha-1 season-1).</span></p>\n<p><span>Fish enhances rice productivity (by 10-15 per cent) by controlling the growth of algae, weeds and insects, providing nutrient input through fish excreta and promoting tillering of the rice through the movement of fish inside the field. </span></p>\n<p><span>Further, the mineralisation of organic matter, puddling of mud and soil aeration by other benthos enhances rice yield here. The records of rice and fish yields were obtained from the farmers through personal interviews.</span></p>\n<p>Dykes at a higher elevation and lower elevation are constructed with a height of 0.9 m to 1.5 m and 0.4 to 0.6 m. These dykes are also used to remove water from the field during harvesting. Bamboo fencing is done to avoid the escape of fish through the pipes.</p>\n<p>This eco-friendly and economically beneficial practice has made the system unique in terms of aquatic resource utilisation.</p>\n<p>The zooplankton and algal life forms serve as natural food sources for the fish in the flooded rice fields to enhance aquatic productivity. This ecosystem service, in turn, indirectly maintains healthy human-made swamps with better livelihood options for tribal framers.</p>\n<p>Field water depth is the limiting factor. All the agro-inputs in this ecosystem with organic manures, decomposed rice stubbles and macrophytes, along with other biotic and abiotic factors, regulate their various population properties in the inundated rice fields.</p>\n<p>For growth and development, the stocked fish in the rice field may have utilised and assimilated available aquatic biomass and zooplankton through trophic interactions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, high-altitude flooded environments enriched with such natural fish feeds have sufficient scope to raise fish as a concurrent crop of rice in the same field.</p>\n<p>In the context of plankton and other fish food organisms, the wet rice fields are still data deficient. The water quality parameters, community structure and population dynamics of algal life forms under the rice canopy are favourable for the growth and abundance of zooplankton, which greatly influences the fish yield.</p>\n<p>Therefore, such unique integrated farming systems require special attention for better productivity and profitability to the small-scale rural farmers in Assam and other northeastern hill states.</p>\n<h3>Read more:</h3>\n<p><em>Views expressed are the authors’ own and don’t necessarily reflect those of</em> Down To Earth</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.

A farmer can be termed as the first person to be impacted by climate change since s/he is in a livelihood that directly depends on climate.</p>\n<p>This affects the country’s overall agricultural output and also adds to food inflation. High food prices could result in people slashing down consumption as well. This, on the other hand, impacts negatively on nutritional security.</p>\n<p>Among farming households, a significant number produce food for their own consumption. These households gave birth to the old saying that those who eat their own food are also the healthiest ones.</p>\n<p>For countries like India where malnutrition is high and food insecurity is a nagging constant, such households have used the home production system to remain out of it.</p>\n<p>As many studies point out, these households are also protected from market fluctuations thus ensuring their affordability for healthy food. Obviously, they are not impacted by food inflation as well.</p>\n<p>But serious conversations are taking place over how climate change-induced extreme weather events would impact such households. To begin with, we need to know the linkage between nutrition intake and household food production; and whether weather fluctuation would have any impact on this.</p>\n<p>A recent research paper from the <a href=\"https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136557/filename/136768.pdf\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> (IFPRI) attempts to answer the first question: How much do weather conditions impact a home food production system?</p>\n<p>Researchers Hiroyuki Takeshima, Sunil Saroj and Anjani Kumar have analysed village-level data from households on their own food production and consumption and correlated the local weather situations to infer whether there was a significant relationship.</p>\n<p>The IFPRI paper first established that people growing their own food consume more, thus adding to nutrition level and also attaining overall food security. “On average, growing grain crops at home led to Rs 12.184 higher average grain consumption per month per household,” found the research paper.</p>\n<p>This trend is not limited only to grains. Consumption increases significantly for pulses, dairy, vegetables and fruits, if grown at home. The research could establish a link between increased consumption and reduction in child stunting, underweight and women achieving normal body-mass-index. These trends are more pronounced in remote villages.</p>\n<p>But these ‘positive effects’ of growing your own food are observed to be ‘significantly magnified’ if the weather is closer to normal. This is the most definitive linkage of climate and food intake established by this research paper among the food-growing households.</p>\n<p>If the rainfall is one standard deviation closer to the normal figure, grain consumption increases by Rs 12.282. Similarly, if the temperature is one standard deviation from normal, consumption increases by Rs 5.723. This also means that normal weather will increase all other physical benefits.</p>\n<p>This implies that if these households experience adverse weather conditions, their overall food and nutritional security would be negatively impacted. Also, without normal weather, they may have to depend more on markets thus spending more on food than before. This would have an impact on overall economic well being.</p>\n<p>This makes the case for climate-proofing these food producers who till now remain untouched from the crisis. Moreover, these are the people who are yet to be impacted by the market-driven agriculture system. While climate change takes all under its grips, this system of food production needs a prudent reaction.</p>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory/agriculture\">\r\n                कृषि        </a> \r\n            से जुड़ी सभी खबरें <a href=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/hindistory\">हिंदी</a>  में पढ़ें।</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.instamojo.com/downtoearth/donation-for-cse-fa166/\">SUPPORT US <img src=\"https://www.downtoearth.org.in/static/new_assets/img/donate%20(1).png\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We are a voice to you; you have been a support to us.
