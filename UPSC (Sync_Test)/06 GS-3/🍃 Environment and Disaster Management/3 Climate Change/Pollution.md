 ### Pollutants

#### Classification 
-   **Primary Pollutants** : persist in the form in which they are added viz **DDT**, plastic 
-   **Secondary Pollutants** : formed by interaction among primary ones.
-   **Quantitative pol**. : they **occur naturally** and become polluting where their conc reaches beyond a threshhold
-   Qualitative pol : do not occur in nature and are **man-made**.
-   Biodegradable ex waster produects
-   Non-Biodegradable that are not decomposed.
-   Natural and Anthorpogenic are other types


 #### Major air pollutants and their sources 
 
 ###### Carbon Monoxide CO
-   colourless, **odourless** gas that is produced by the incomplete burning
-   lowers the amount of oxygen makes reflexes slow and confused.

###### Carbon dioxide (CO2) :
-   principle greenhouse gas emitted
 
 ###### Chloroflorocarbons (CFC) :
-   from air-conditioning systems and refrigeration
-   rise to the stratosphere and dec the conc of ozone layer
 
 ###### Lead :
-   present in petrol, diesel, lead batteries, paints, hair dye products, etc. Lead affects children in particular.
-   cause nervous system damage and digestive problems and cancer
 
 ###### Ozone :

-   occurs naturally in the upper layers of the atmosphere
-   but at ground level it is a pollutant and is highly toxic
-   Vehicles and industries are the major source
-   makes our eyes itch, burn, and water
-   lowers our resistance to cold and pneumonia
 
 ###### Nitrogen oxide (Nox) :

-   causes smog and acid rain
-   produced from burning fuels including petrol, diesel, and coal
-   makes children susceptible to respiratory diseases in winter
 
 ###### Suspended particulate matter (SPM)
-   major source of haze which reduces visibility
-   consists of solids in the air in form of smoke, dust and vapour
 

 ###### Sulphur dioxide (SO2) :

-   sources from thermal power plants, paper and smelting industries.
-   contributor to smog and acid rain it leads to lung diseases.
-   Heavy smog require **calm wind** and is common in winters. It decreases ultraviolet radiation and dec the production of natural Vitamin D.
 
 #### Indoor sources of pollutions :  
 
**Volatile organic compounds** : sources are perfumes, hair sprays, furniture polish, glues, air fresheners, moth repellents etc
-   irritation of the eye, nose and throat, headaches, nausea and loss of coordination
-   long term - suspected to damage the liver
 
**Tobacco** :  is carcinogenic, causes burning eyes etc.
 
 **Biological pollutants**
-   includes pollen from plants, mite, and hair from pets, fungi, parasites, and some bacteria.  Formaldehyde
-   From carpets, particle boards, and insulation foam
-   Causes irritation to eye and nose
 
 **Radon**
-   emitted naturally by the soil, poor ventilation traps these in houses causing lung cancers.
-   Asbestos and Pesticides are other examples.
 

##### Fly Ash
- aka Flue ash or pulverised fuel ash it is a coal combustion product
-   rises with the gases into the atmosphere, very fine powder. Ones which do not rise are called as bottom ash.
-   composed of Aluminium silicate, Silicon dioxide (SiO2), Calcium oxide (CaO), Aluminium Oxide (Al2O3) they also consist of oxides of iron, calcium, magnesium etc.
- have heavy metals
- Radiation emitted by them are 100 times more than nuclear waste

-   Ionising radiation have high penetration power viz X rays, cosmic rays and atomic radiations

 Types of radiation particles :
-   Alpha particles - blocked by a piece of paper and human skin
-   Beta - penetrates through skin but glass and metal can block it
-   Gamma - can penetrate and damage cells, only be blocked by thick concrete

- Effects
- land gets littered, causes reproductive problems in humans and wildlife
-   **Dioxin** (highly carcinogenic and toxic) by-product of the manufacturing process of plastic is one of the chemicals believed to be passed on through **breast milk** to the nursing infant.
-  Burning of plastics, especially PVC releases **dioxin** and **furan** into the atmosphere.
-   Contamination of groundwater and soil through landfills is known as **leaching**. To counter this **sanitary** landfills are made.
- Types are Municipal, Hazardous, Biomedical/hospital ex formaldehyde, phenols, anatomical waste
- [[Acts and Policies#Solid Waste Management Rules SWM 2016| Solid Waste Management Rules 2016]] #PrelimsPYQ 

##### Treatment of Plastic Waste
-   **Pyrolysis** of carbonaceous wastes yields charcoal along with products like **tar**, **methyl alcohol**, acetic acid, acetone and a fuel gas. #PrelimsPYQ 
-   Open dumps, landfills, sanitary landfills, incineration plants, pyrolysis, composting etc
 - Waste Minimisation Circles WMC : WB assisted, for minimising waste in Industrial clusters and plants 

### Plastic Pollution
- plastic contamination of marine environment and land
- rate of UV induced photo-oxidative degradation is very slow and there is no easy way of collection of debris
- they degrade to give out micoparticulate particles <20microns in size adversely affecting marine animals


### **Thermal pollution** 
- is the rise or fall in the temperature of a natural aquatic environment caused by human influence.
- Sources are power plants, cooling water from factories, soil erosion, deforestation
- Causes algal bloom, affects ecosys composition
- Impact : death of acqutic organisms, migration of animals
- can also be caused by releasing extremely cold water
- Control Measure
	- **Cogeneration** : process through which, the excess heat energy from generating electricity can be used in another manufacturing process that needs such energy. #important 
	- treatment of discharge water their efficient use esp in power plants.
 
### Bioremediation :

-   **Bioremediation** is the use of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) to degrade the environmental contaminants into less toxic forms.
-   It can be monitored indirectly by measuring the Oxidation Reduction Potential  or redox in soil and groundwater, pH, temperature, oxygen content, electron acceptor/donor concentrations, and concentration of breakdown products.

#### In Situ bioremediation :
-   Bioventing -- supply of air and nutrients through wells to contaminated soil to stimulate the growth of indigenous bacteria.
-   Biosparging - Injection of air under pressure below the water table to increase groundwater oxygen concentrations.
-   Bioaugmentation - Microorganisms are imported to a contaminated site to enhance degradation process

#### Ex situ :
-   Landfarming - contaminated soil is excavated and spread over a prepared bed and periodically tilled until pollutants are degraded.
-   Biopiles - it is a hybrid of landfarming and composting. Engineered cells are constructed as aerated composted piles. Uses petroleum hydrocarbons.
-   Bioreactors -- it involves the processing of contaminated solid material (soil, sediment, sludge) or water through an engineered containment system.
-   Composting

####  Genetic Engineering approaches to bioremediation :
-   **Phytoremediation** is use of plants to remove contaminants from soil and water.
-   Phytoextraction / phytoaccumulation is the process by which plants accumulate contaminants into the roots and above ground shoots or leaves.
-   Phytotransformation or phytodegradation refers to the uptake of organic contaminants from soil, sediments, or water and their transformation to more stable, less toxic, less mobile form.
-   Phytostabilization is a technique in which plants reduce      the mobility and migration of contaminated soil.
-   Phytodegradation or rhizodegradation is the breakdown of contaminants through the activity existing in the rhizosphere.
-   Rhizofiltration is a water remediation technique that involves the uptake of contaminants by plant roots.

####  **Mycoremediation** and Mycofiltration 
- is a form of bioremediation in which fungi are used to  decontaminate the area. 
 - Mycofiltration is a similar process, using fungal mycelia to filter toxic waste and microorganisms from water in soil.
 
###  Acid Rain
- Rain with a pH of less than **5.6** is acid rain.
- concentrated in industrialised belt of nothern hemisphere
- common in mountainous areas 
- impacts soil, wildlife, microorganisms, Vegetation and Humans
- It increases the effect of other harmful pollutants this is called a trigger effect ex Mercury, Al, Cadmium, Lead, Asbestos
 
####  Types of Deposition
 - Wet Deposition : acid air blown to areas where weather is wet, rainout and washout are processes that remove gases and particles from atmosphere
 - Dry Deposition : in areas where weather is dry 
 
####  The sources that lead to the formation of acid rain are :
-   Sulphur oxides
-   Nitrogen oxides
-   **Formic** acid
-   **Chlorine**
-   Phosphoric
-   Hydrochloric acid
-   Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

 Nitrous Oxide N2O is emitted by the use of **fertilizers** in agriculture, burning of **transportation** fuel, production of **Nitric Acid**.
 
 Fluorinated gases : They are non-ozone depleting gases but have very high
**global warming potential** GWP.
 
 There are 3 mains types of fluorinated gases :
-   Hydrofluorocarbons HFCs - are used as refrigerants, aerosol propellants, solvents and fire retardants.
-   Perfluorocarbons PFCs - produced during Aluminium production and manufacturing of semi conductors.
-   Sulfur Hexafuoride SF6 - used in magnesium processing, semi-conductor manufacturing and as tracer gas for leak detections. It is also used in electrical transmission equipment and circuit breakers.
 
 "Brown carbon" is generally referred for **greenhouse gases** and "black carbon" for **particles** resulting from impure combustion.
 
 Climate "**forcings**" are factors in the climate system that either increase or decrease the effects to the climate system.
 
 Positive forcings such as excess greenhouse gases warm the earth while negative forcings, such as the effects of most **aerosols** and volcanic eruptions, actually **cool** the earth. 
 
 The power of a process to alter the climate is estimated by its "**radiative forcing**" which is the change in the Earth's energy balance due to that process.
 
 The factors that cause Ocean acidification are :

-   **Acid rain**
-   **Eutrophication**
- respiration of bacteria decomposing algae leads to dec. in sea water pH.
 

 Q. Events where deeper ocean water circulates onto continental shelves and near-shore areas are called? 
 A. Upwelling
 

 The **upper** layers of the ocean tend to be supersaturated with CaCO3 so little dissolution takes place, whilst the deep  ocean is undersaturated and carbonate readily dissolves.

 The first boundary between these two states is known as the lysocline.
