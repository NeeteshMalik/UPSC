**4 types of Carbon**
1. **Black Carbon** : They are also black carbon that cause more pollution that Brown carbon. Component of fine particulate matter of size 2.5 micro meter. Consists of pure carbon that originates from incomplete complete combution of fossil fuels, coal, biofuel, biomass etc It originates from pyrolysis. Ex Soot
2. **Brown Carbon** : They are green house gases ex CO2. Smoke released by combustion of organic matter that coexists with black carbon when released in atmosphere.
	- Significant global warming factors that disturbs the temperature pattern of atmosphere and cloud forming process. 
1. **Blue Carbon** : Captured by worlds oceans and coastal ecosystems. Stored in the form of aquatic biomass ex seagrasses, mangroves, marshes are ex of vegetated coastal blue carbon ecosystems. 
2. **Green Carbon** : Carbon captured into terrestrial plant biomass in photosynthesis and stored in plants and soils of natural ecosystems and is vital part of carbon cycle.

## Classification :

-   Primary Pollutant : persist in the form they are added, Secondary - formed by interaction w/ Primary ex peroxyacetyl nitrate
-   Quantitative P : when conc increase beyond threshold, Qualitative - man made
-   Biodegradable : Non Bio, Natural - Anthropogenic are other classification

## Air Pollution
-   Air Pollutants and their sources
    -   CO : colourless, odourless, slows reflex, causes confusion
    -   CO2 :: greenhouse gas, impairs reflexes, vision, headaches, heart strain
    -   CFC : from AC/fridges, reduces O3 after contact w/ other gases
    -   Pb : affects children, nervous system damage, digestive problems
    -   O3 : ==pollutant at ground level== causes smog, from vehicles & industries, makes eyes itch, burn, water, lowers resistance to cold and pneumonia, wheezing, chest pain, emphysema, bronchitis
    -   NOx : causes smog, acid rain, makes children prone to respiratory illness in winter, lung inflammation etc
    -   SPM : ==main sources of Haze==, reduces RBC development
    -   SO2/SOx : source is burning coal, industrial processes, smelting. Causes smog, acid rain, SO2, eye throat irritation, impairs enzyme fn, causes chlorosis, plasmolysis in plants
    -   Smog : O3 leads to it, photochemical smog is a type, decreases UV radiation and Vitamin D deficiency
    -   Mercury : from industries, nervous disorders, kidney issues, impairs brain, interferes w/ RBC dev
    -   Cadmium : from industries, affects heart,
    -   Dust from Silica, Asbestos, Cotton textiles
    -   Radioactive pollutants : Cosmic rays, x rays, beta rays, destroys living tissues, leukemia, affects cell membrane
    
###   Indoor Air P 
- in rural areas mostly caused due to fuel burning -> chemical agents produced are CO, polycyclic organic matter, formaldehyde
- In Urban areas -> chemical agents responsible for it are NO2, CO, Pb

#### Indoor Sources of Pollution 

-   Volatile Organic Compounds : perfumes, air sprays, polishes, glues, etc causes nausea, eye irritation, damages liver
-   Tobacco : burning eyes, throat irritation, cancer etc
-   Biological P : pollen, pet hairs, fungi, parasites, bacteria
-   Formaldehyde : from carpets, insulation foams, particle boards, eye irritation, allergies
-   Radon : emitted naturally by soil, lung cancer
-   Asbestos
-   Pesticides

##### Fly Ash 
- rises w/ gases in the atm after combustion composed of Aluminium silicate, SiO2, CaO, rich in oxides, also has Fe oxides, Ca, Mg, Pb, Arsenic, Cobalt, Cu
-   Causes air, water P ; respiratory issues, settles on leaves/crops lowering yield,
-   Used in cement, brick, road embankment, to reclaim wasteland, fill abandoned mines, inc crop yield
