# Mineral and Rocks

- Have fixed atomic structure, definite chemical composition, 2 or more elements
- Crystals appear when Magma cools,  

**Physical characterstics of minerals**  :

-   External **crystal form** ex cubes, hexagonal etc
-   **Cleavage** - tendency to break forming plane surfaces
-   **Fracture** - Crystals break irregularly not along cleavage
-   Lustre
-   Other characterstics are colour, streak (colour of ground powder), transparency, structure, hardness and specific gravity.

Metallic Mineral : contain metals ex Precious metals, Ferrous and Non Ferrous metals 
Non Metallic - ex Sulphur, Nitrates etc

### Rocks
- Do not have definite compositin of minerals
- Petrology is study of rocks

#### Igneous Rocks

-   Formed by cooling and solidification of Magma and Lava aka primary rocks
-   If molten material is cooled slowly at great depths mineral grains will be **very large**
-   Sudden cooling will result in **small and smooth** grains, Intermediate condition will make medium sized grains
-   Examples of igneous rocks are granite, gabbro, pegmatite, basalt, volcanic breccia and tuff

#### Sedimentary Rocks

- Formed when Igneous, Sedimentary, Metamorphic rocks undergo denudation are later carried and deposited
- Compaction results in their formation aka **lithifaction**

What are the different types of Sedimentary rocks?
-   **Mechanically** formed eg sandstone, conglomerate, limestone, shale, loess
-   **Organically** formed eg geyserite, chalk, limestone, coal etc
-   **Chemically** formed eg chert, limestone, halite, potash etc.

#### Metamorphic Rocks
- Changes form under action of Pressure, Volume, Temp
- Techtonic process force rocks down which come into contact w/ molten magma, rocks above subject huge pressure -> recrystallisation, reorganisation.
- **Dynamic Metamorphism** : change due to rushing and breaking but w/o chemical change
- **Thermal Metamorphism** :  
	-   **Contact** metamorphism - occurs when rocks come into contact with hot magma and lava
	-   **Regional** metamorphism occurs due deformation caused by tectonic shearing.
-   Rocks, grains or minerals get arranged in layers or lines during metamorphism this is called **Foliation** or **Lineation**
-   Alternating layer of light and dark shades in minerals are called **Banding**
-   MR Classified into foliated and Non foliated 
-   Examples rocks are :  **Gneissoid, Granite, Syenite,** Slate, Schist, Marble, Quartzite

# Geomorphic Processes
- Forces that bring change to surface.
- Exogenic forces cause degradation and aggradation on surface ex Weathering, wasting, erosion and deposition.
- Gradation : Wearing down of relief variation through erosion.

### Endogenic Geomorphic Processes
- Energy from within ex Radioactivity, Rotation and Tidal Friction and Primordial heat
1. Diastrophism : cause surface to move, elevate, build up earth's crust . Various types of diastrophic processes are :
	-   **Orogenic** :  mountain building through **severe folding** and affects long and narrow belts of earth
	-   **Epeirogenic** : uplift or warping of large parts of crust; continental building process.
	- Earthquakes 
	-   Plate techtonics
1. [[Earth#Volcanoes| Volcanism]]
### Exogenic Geomorphic Processes
-   Energy source is atmosphere
-   ==All exogenic forces cause denudation== of material
-   Mechanical and chemical decomposition by weather and climate : Weathering
-   Weathering, Mass Wasting, Erosion and Deposition are examples

#### Types
- ##### **Weathering** : 
	- Mechanical disintegration and Chemical decomposition
	- causes are geological, climatic, topographic, vegetative factors
		- Chemical  : ex carbonation, hydration, oxidation etc 
		- Physical/Mechanical : ex gravity, expansion due to temp, water pressure
		- Biological : changes caused due to growth/movement of organisms
	
	Exfoliation #card-reverse
	-   Result of Weathering
	-   **Flaking of curved sheets of shells** from rocks etc to form smooth and rounded surface 
	-   caused due to expansion and contraction 
	
- ##### Mass Movement
	-  Rock debris movt under direct influence of Gravity
	-  Weathering not a prerequisite 
	-  No geomorphic processes participate viz glaciers, wind, waves, currents etc
	-  Heave, flow and slide are types of movt

	Landslides
	-   Rapid movt of rock in a slope without backward movt is called Slide
	-   Slump is flow w/ backwards rotation of material, slide has no such phenomena

##### Erosion and Deposition
- Weathering not a precondition
- Deposition is consequence of erosion when agents lose their[[Soils#Soil Formation|Soil Formation]] is a consequence of it
