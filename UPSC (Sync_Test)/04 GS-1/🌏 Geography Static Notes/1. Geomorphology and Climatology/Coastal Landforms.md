## Waves and Current

- **Coastal landforms** depends on the *following factors *:
	-   Action of the waves
	-   Configuration of land and sea floor
	-   Whether the coast is **advacning seaward or retreating landward**.

### High Rocky Coasts
- Long ridges of sand and/or shingle deposited on the beaches along the shore are called Bars 
- Bars are submerged features *when they show up above water* they are called  Barrier Bars. 
- Barrier bar which get keyed up to the headland of a bay is called a **spit**
- When barrier bars and **spits** form at the mouth of a bay and block it, a **lagoon** forms.
- Lagoons would gradually get filled up by sediments from the land giving rise to a coastal plain.

#### Low Sedimentary Coasts
- Coastal Plains, deltas are common; lagoons, tidal creeks are occassional
- Lagoon first forms swam and then coastal plain

### Wave Erosional Landform
- Wave cut cliffs, terraces are common
- Wave-cut terrace are Formed at the foot of the cliff it is a flat or gently sloping platform covered by rock debris derived from sea cliff behind.

-  Sea Caves are formed by *Lashing and smashing of the waves containing rock debris against the base* of the cliff forms.
-  When sea caves collapse the ***sea cliffs retreat further inland leaving behing resistant mass of rocks*** the are called Sea Stacks.

### Wave Depositional Landforms
- Beaches:  are formed by deposition, Temporary feature, sandunes are common behind a beach
- Offshore bars are ridge of sand lying paralled from low tide waterline to seaward.

## Winds

### Wind Erosional Landform 

-  Pediments : gently** inclined rocky floors **close to the mountains at their foot with or without a thin cover of debris.**

-   When pediments extends backwards at the expense of mountain from it gets reduced to an **inselberg**. 
-   The areas around it are knows as **Pediplains**.
-   Due to gradual deposition of sediment from basin margins with mountains and hill, a nearly level plain forms at the centre of the basin, this gets filled by water forming a shallow lake called a **Playa**.
	-   most prominent landform in desert, water retained only for short time
-   Playa plains filled up by salts is called Alkali flats.
-   **Deflation hollows** formed due to  weathering away of the mantle of rocks by the action of wind.
-   Deflation creates ***pits and cavities in rocks*** leading to the formation of Caves. ![[Landforms-image10-00085771.jpg]]
-   Mushroom, Table and Pedestal rocks are some other forms

### Wind Depositional 

###### Sand Dunes
-   Crescent shaped dunes called **barchans**.
-   **Parabolic dunes** form when sandy surfaces are partially covered with vegetation. The parabolic dunes are reversed barchans.
-   **Seif** is similar to barchan but has only one wing or point.
-   **Longitudnal dunes** form when supply of sand is poor and wind direction is constant.
-   **Transverse dunes** are aligned perpendicular to the wind direction.
