1. Why was there a sudden spurt in famines in colonial India since the mid-eighteenth century ? Give reasons. (औपननवेशिक भारत की अठारहवीं िताबी के मध् से क्ो अकाल प ं डने में अचानक वृगधि देखने को गमलती है? कारण बताएं।) 2022

```ad-Answer

The mid-eighteenth century saw a sudden spurt in famines in colonial India due to a number of factors. Historian David Arnold has argued that “the increasing impact of colonial rule and the changes it brought in the agrarian and commercial structure of Indian society, combined with a series of bad harvests, caused a series of famines of unprecedented severity.” 

The introduction of new taxation systems, especially the Permanent Settlement in Bengal, led to a significant shift in the agrarian structure of India. This resulted in a decrease in the amount of land available for cultivation, a rise in land rents and a decrease in the number of people employed in the agricultural sector. This created a situation of food insecurity, as people were unable to produce enough food to meet their needs.

Furthermore, the colonial government’s policies of free trade and laissez-faire economics resulted in a decrease in the price of food grains, leading to a decrease in the income of farmers. This further exacerbated the situation of food insecurity.

Additionally, colonial policies of land alienation and the displacement of peasants from their lands led to a decrease in the amount of land available for cultivation. This further reduced the amount of food that could be produced, leading to a situation of food insecurity and famine.

Data from the British government shows that between 1770 and 1866, there were at least twenty-four major famines in India, killing around 10 million people. This illustrates the severity of the famines and the extent of the food insecurity in colonial India. 

Various other reasons for famines were : 

1.  Natural Disasters: Drought, floods and other natural disasters have been a major cause of famines in colonial India, leading to crop failures and food shortages.
    
2.  Exploitative Economic Policies: The British colonial government implemented economic policies that drained resources from India, leading to poverty and food insecurity. This included the forced cultivation of cash crops for export, which depleted the food supply, and the introduction of the salt tax, which increased the cost of food.
    
3.  Deforestation and Land Degradation: Deforestation and land degradation in India during colonial times contributed to famines by reducing the availability of fertile land for agriculture. 
    
4.  Lack of Government Intervention: The colonial government often failed to provide adequate relief during famines, either because of a lack of resources or because of a belief that famine was a natural occurrence that should be left to run its course.
    
5.  Transportation Disruptions: Famines were often exacerbated by disruptions in transportation, such as railway strikes or blockades, which prevented food from reaching areas in need. This led to food shortages and skyrocketing food prices, making it difficult for poor people to afford enough to eat.

In conclusion, the mid-eighteenth century saw a sudden spurt in famines in colonial India due to the introduction of new taxation systems, the implementation of free trade policies, land alienation and displacement of peasants, and a series of bad harvests. These factors combined to create a situation of food insecurity and led to the death of millions of people.

4.  Effective Logistics: The British army had a more efficient logistics system, which allowed them to sustain their troops and supplies during long campaigns. They avoided carrying civilian followers with them
    
5.  Effective Espionage: The British made effective use of espionage to gather information on the plans and movements of their enemies, allowing them to gain an advantage. Their system of Residents was a way to collect information on the native rulers. 
    
6.  Divide and Rule: The British employed the strategy of divide and rule, by supporting one Indian ruler against another, thereby weakening the unity of the Indian resistance.They effectively used this against Siraj Ud Daulah by creating factionism in his court by allying with Mir Jafar, Jagath Seth etc.
    
7.  Tactical Flexibility: The British army was tactically flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances on the battlefield, which gave them an advantage over the more rigid and traditional armies of the Indian rulers.

9.  Leadership: The British had effective leaders, such as Robert Clive and Charles Cornwallis, who were able to inspire and lead their troops to victory.
    
10.  Psychological Warfare: The British employed psychological warfare techniques, such as using their red coats and bugle calls to intimidate their enemies, which had a demoralizing effect on the Indian armies.
    

Examples: The Battle of Plassey in 1757, the Battle of Buxar in 1764, and the First Anglo-Maratha War of 1775-1782 are a few examples of the victories of the British East India Company against the Indian rulers.

1. Trace the rise and growth of socio-religious reform movements with special reference to Young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj. (यंग बं गाल एवं ब्रह्ो समाज के नविेष सं दभ्भ में सामाजजक-धार्मक सुधार आन्ोलनो के उत् ं ान तथिा नवकास को रेखांहकत कीजजए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

The socio-religious reform movements of India were a result of the growing awareness among the people of their rights and a desire for a better future. These movements sought to bring about social and religious reforms in the Indian society. The reform movements of the 19th century were mainly led by the educated middle class and aimed to bring about a social revolution. The most prominent among these were the Young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj movements.

The Young Bengal movement was started by Henry Vivian Derozio in the early 19th century. He was a teacher at the Hindu College in Calcutta and was the first to introduce western ideas of free thought and rationalism in the Indian education system. He encouraged his students to think freely and question the existing social norms and practices. He also advocated for the rights of women and the lower castes. This movement was a radical departure from the traditional Indian thought and it was met with a lot of resistance from the conservative sections of society.

The Brahmo Samaj movement was founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1828. Roy was a strong advocate of the modernisation of Indian society and he sought to bring about social reforms in the country. He was a staunch believer of monotheism and sought to bring about reforms in the Indian religious practices. He was also a strong advocate of women’s rights and sought to abolish the practice of Sati. He was also a proponent of modern education and sought to bring about reforms in the Indian education system.

The Young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj movements had a profound impact on Indian society. They sought to bring about social and religious reforms in the country and were successful in their efforts. They helped to bring about a new wave of liberalism and modernity in the Indian society. They also helped to bring about a new awareness among the people of their rights and a desire for a better future.

The Young Bengal and Brahmo Samaj movements were instrumental in bringing about social and religious reforms in the Indian society. As Raja Ram Mohan Roy said, “The essence of true religion is to be found in the recognition of the unity of God, the brotherhood of man, and the fatherhood of God.” These movements helped to bring about a new wave of liberalism and modernity in the Indian society and helped to create a better future for the people.

1. To what extent did the role of the Moderates prepare a base for the wider freedom movement? Comment. (नरमपंसथियो की भू ं गमका ने हकस सीमा तक व्यापक स्तंत्रता आंदोलन का आधार तैयार हकया? हिपण्ी कीजजए।) 2021

```ad-Answer

The moderates were a group of Indian Nationalists who were active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were characterized by their belief in the use of constitutional methods, such as petitions, deputations, and negotiations with the British, to achieve political goals. They were generally opposed to the use of violence or militant tactics, which were embraced by the extremists of the era.

The most prominent moderates included Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Pherozeshah Mehta, and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. These leaders were all members of the Indian National Congress, which was established in 1885. They sought to reform the colonial system and improve the lives of Indians through political means.

Naoroji, for example, was a prominent figure in the Indian National Congress and was the first Indian Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons. He argued for Indian self-rule and for the protection of Indian workers in the British Empire. Gokhale was another leader of the Indian National Congress who advocated for social and economic reform. He was a mentor to Mahatma Gandhi and was instrumental in the formation of the Servants of India Society in 1905.

Tilak was also a prominent moderate leader. He was initially an extremist, but later shifted to a more moderate stance. He used the press to spread his ideas, and was a major advocate of swaraj (self-rule). He was imprisoned several times by the British for his activities.

The moderates used a variety of tactics to pressure the British government. They organized petitions, held public meetings, and published articles in the press. They also used negotiations to try to achieve their goals. Ultimately, their efforts helped to lay the groundwork for the more militant tactics later adopted by the Indian National Congress and other nationalist groups.

How Moderates provided a base for wider freedom movements : 

1.  Ideological Foundation: The Moderates provided the ideological foundation for the wider freedom movement by advocating for constitutional and parliamentary reform within the framework of British rule. This was significantly away from the liberal thought that was led by leaders like Surendranath Banerjea.
    
2.  Mobilization of Public Opinion: The Moderates were successful in mobilizing public opinion in support of their cause, creating a mass movement for political change. Tilaks Ganpati and Shivaji festvals saw massive trunouts.
    
3.  Use of Constitutional Methods: The Moderates emphasized the use of constitutional methods, such as petitioning and peaceful protest, which provided a model for future non-violent resistance. Ex Dadabha Naoroji joining the British Parliament as member and establishing London India Society to discuss issues plaguing India.
    
4.  Education and Awareness: The Moderates played a key role in educating and raising awareness among the Indian masses about political and social issues, paving the way for wider public involvement in the freedom movement. They brought about various newspapers like Rast Goftar, Kesari and Mahrattha, Hitvada etc.
    
5.  Representation of Indian Interests: The Moderates represented Indian interests in negotiations with the British government and helped to bring about some political concessions, such as the Indian Councils Act of 1909. 
    
6.  Creation of Nationalistic Sentiment: The Moderates helped to create a sense of nationalistic sentiment among Indians, laying the groundwork for the later demand for independence. 
    
7.  Development of Political Institutions: The Moderates played a key role in the development of political institutions in India, such as the Indian National Congress, which would later become the centerpiece of the freedom movement.
    
8.  Support for Local Movements: The Moderates supported and gave momentum to local movements, such as the Non-Cooperation Movement, which helped to build the wider national freedom struggle.
    
9.  Bridge between British and Indian Elites: The Moderates served as a bridge between British and Indian elites, helping to foster greater understanding and cooperation between the two sides.
    
10.  Legacy of Non-Violence: The Moderates left behind a legacy of non-violent resistance, which would later be adopted and popularized by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi. Their strong disapproval of Revolutionary terrorism limited govt militaristic response against them created a non-violence base to achieve freedom.

1. Evaluate the policies of Lord Curzon and their long term implications on the national movement. (लाड्भ कज्भन की नीनतयो एवं रा ं टिट्ीय आंदोलन पर उनके दूरगामी प्भावो का मूल ं ांकन कीजजए।) 2020

```ad-Answer

Lord Curzon was the Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905. He is known for his modernizing reforms and for his authoritarian attitude. He is also remembered for his aggressive policy towards the Indian National Movement. His policies had both positive and negative implications on the national movement.

One of the most important policies of Lord Curzon was the partition of Bengal in 1905. This was done to weaken the Bengali nationalist movement, which was growing in strength. The partition was seen as a deliberate attempt to divide the Bengali people and weaken their political power. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it sparked off a period of intense political agitation, leading to the formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885.

Another important policy of Lord Curzon was the introduction of the Indian Councils Act of 1909. This Act gave Indians greater representation in the government, but it also increased the powers of the Viceroy, making him virtually unaccountable to the Indian people. This policy had both positive and negative implications on the national movement. On the one hand, it gave Indians greater representation in the government and allowed them to voice their grievances to the Viceroy. On the other hand, it increased the power of the Viceroy and made it difficult for Indians to challenge his decisions.

Lord Curzon also introduced the Universities Act of 1904, which allowed the government to control the syllabus and the appointment of professors in universities. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it restricted the freedom of expression and the spread of nationalist ideas in educational institutions.

Lord Curzon also introduced the Police Act of 1902, based on the Fraser committee report, which gave the police greater powers to suppress dissent and protest. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it made it more difficult for Indians to organize protests and voice their grievances.

Lord Curzon also introduced the Indian Antiquities Act of 1904, which gave the government the power to control the excavation and preservation of ancient monuments. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it restricted the freedom of expression and made it difficult for Indians to preserve their cultural heritage. 

Lord Curzon also introduced the Official Secrets Act of 1904, which gave the government the power to prosecute anyone who leaked official information.Punishments under the Act range from three years to life imprisonment. This policy had a long-term impact on the national movement, as it made it difficult for nationalists to access information and organize protests.

Lord Curzon also implemented various policies that aimed to improve the living conditions of Indian society, however, many of these policies were controversial. He introduced the Plague Code that aimed to tackle the spread of the bubonic plague but it was heavily criticized as it violated people's civil liberties. Additionally, his policies on education were aimed at promoting Western education in India, which was seen as an attempt to Anglicize Indian society.

In conclusion, Lord Curzon's policies had both positive and negative implications on the national movement. His policies of partitioning Bengal, introducing the Indian Councils Act, the Universities Act, the Police Act, the Press Act, the Indian Antiquities Act and the Official Secrets Act had a long-term impact on the national movement, as they restricted the freedom of expression, weakened the political power of the people and made it difficult for Indians to access information and organize protests.

Further more, the long-term implications of Lord Curzon's policies on the national movement were significant. His policies fueled anti-British sentiment in India and gave rise to a more organized and unified national movement. The partition of Bengal in 1905, in particular, galvanized Indian public opinion and led to the growth of the national movement. Additionally, his policies on education, religion, and culture inspired Indian intellectuals to reclaim their cultural heritage and resist British cultural domination.

```ad-Answer


The Indian national movement, which was aimed at gaining independence from British rule, was shaped by various ideological strands. Here are some of the most prominent ones:

1.  Liberal Nationalism: This ideology was based on the idea of constitutionalism and representative government. It was championed by the moderate leaders of the Indian National Congress, who believed in using constitutional means, such as negotiations and petitioning, to achieve independence. 
	- Ex the idea of swaraj or self-rule. This was articulated by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, who argued that India should be governed by Indians, without the interference of the British. This idea of self-rule was further developed by leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, who sought to establish a secular, democratic republic in India.
    
2.  Socialism: This ideology was based on the idea of equality and the redistribution of wealth and resources. It was adopted by a section of the Indian National Congress, who believed in using socialist principles to address the social and economic problems of India.
    
3.  Hindu Nationalism: This ideology was based on the idea of Hindu cultural and religious nationalism. It was championed by the Hindu nationalist organizations, such as the Hindu Mahasabha, who believed in the primacy of Hindu culture and religion in India.
	- For example, the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha sought to mobilize the Hindu community
    
4.  Islamic Nationalism and Pan Islamism : This ideology was based on the idea of Islamic cultural and religious nationalism. It was championed by Muslim nationalist organizations, such as the All India Muslim League, who believed in the primacy of Islamic culture and religion in India. 
	- It also acquired a social strand in the form of the Khilafat movement. This movement was launched to protest the British treatment of the Ottoman Empire and the Caliph of Islam. The Khilafat movement sought to unite Hindus and Muslims in a common cause and to promote communal harmony.
    
5.  National-Populism: This ideology was based on the idea of mass mobilization and the empowerment of the common people. It was adopted by the leaders of the Indian National Congress, who believed in using mass mobilization and public opinion to achieve independence.
    
6.  Gandhian Nonviolence or Gandhian Nationalism : This ideology was based on the idea of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. It was championed by Mahatma Gandhi, who believed in using nonviolence as a means of resistance against British rule.
	- Ex the Satyagraha movement. This movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi to promote non-violent resistance to British rule. This movement was based on the principles of ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (truth-force).

7. Feminism : The expansion of the national movement’s social base was also achieved through the efforts of various women’s organizations. These organizations sought to mobilize women in the struggle for independence. For example, the All India Women’s Conference sought to promote the rights of women and to empower them to participate in the national movement.

2.  Sanyasi Rebellion (1773-1775): A revolt led by Hindu ascetics against British rule in Bengal and the east of India.
    
3.  Muddupalani's Revolt (1796): A rebellion led by a poet and courtesan named Rani Muddupalani against the British in Madras.
    
4.  Bhils Uprising (1817-1818): A rebellion led by the Bhil tribe in present-day Madhya Pradesh against British rule and the exploitation of the local population.
    
5.  Kols Uprising (1831): A rebellion led by the Kols tribe in present-day Chhattisgarh against British rule and the exploitation of the local population.
    
7.  Paika Rebellion (1817): A rebellion led by the Paika tribe in present-day Odisha against British rule and the exploitation of the local population.
    
8.  Moplah Rebellion (1921): A revolt led by the Moplah community in present-day Kerala against British rule and Hindu landlordism.
    
10.  Faraizi Movement (1820-1880): A religious and political movement led by Haji Shariatullah in Bengal that aimed to challenge British rule and promote Islamic reforms.

The various pre-1857 rebellions and uprisings in India were important in fueling public anger and discontent towards British rule. These rebellions highlighted the exploitation and oppression of the local population by the British and their Indian allies, and helped to build a sense of solidarity and resistance against colonial rule.

For example, the Santhal Rebellion and the Bhils Uprising brought attention to the plight of tribal communities who were being exploited and oppressed by the British and their allies. The Indigo Revolt and the Faraizi Movement drew attention to the economic exploitation of Indian peasants and the suppression of religious and cultural rights, respectively.

The widespread suffering and resentment caused by these rebellions helped to build a sense of anger and frustration among the Indian people, and provided the backdrop for the 1857 Mutiny. The Mutiny was not just a military uprising, but also a popular uprising that reflected the deep-seated discontent and anger of the Indian people towards British rule.

The Indian Renaissance of the 19th century was a period of cultural, social and political reform in India, marked by a resurgence of Indian intellectualism, cultural expression and national consciousness. It was a period of questioning and challenging the status quo, of breaking down existing social and political hierarchies, of questioning and re-evaluating the traditional values and beliefs of Indian society. The Indian Renaissance was a period of great creativity and intellectual ferment, which saw the emergence of many influential figures and movements.

The Indian Renaissance had a significant impact on the emergence of a national identity in India. It was a period in which Indian intellectuals and reformers began to articulate a shared identity and sense of belonging among the people of India. The Indian Renaissance saw the rise of a new generation of Indian thinkers and activists who sought to challenge the existing social and political structures of the British Raj. These activists and intellectuals began to articulate a vision of an independent India, one that was free from colonial rule and united under a single national identity. This vision of a unified Indian nation was a major factor in the emergence of a national identity in India.

The Indian Renaissance also saw the emergence of new forms of cultural expression and political organization. Indian intellectuals and activists began to articulate a shared sense of identity and pride in Indian culture and history. They sought to revive and promote Indian traditions and values, and to create a unified Indian identity that transcended regional and religious divisions. This shared sense of identity was a major factor in the emergence of a national identity in India.

Finally, the Indian Renaissance saw the rise of a new generation of political activists who sought to challenge the existing social and political structures of the British Raj. These activists sought to create a unified political voice for the people of India, and to fight for independence from colonial rule. This struggle for independence was a major factor in the emergence of a national identity in India, as it provided a platform for Indians to unite and fight for their common cause.

1. Clarify how mid-eighteenth century India was beset with the spectre of a fragmented polity. (सुस्पटि कीजजए हक मध्-अठारहवीं िताबी का भारत नवखं हडत राज्यतंत्र की छाया से हकस प्कार ग्रससत थिा।) 2017

```ad-Answer

The mid-eighteenth century in India was a period of political fragmentation, as the Mughal Empire had all but collapsed and the country was beset with a multitude of regional powers. This fragmentation was caused by a variety of factors, including the weakening of central authority, the rise of regional powers, and the emergence of new religious and political ideologies.

The weakening of Mughal central authority was the primary cause of India’s political fragmentation in the mid-eighteenth century. The Mughal Empire had been in decline since the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, and by the mid-eighteenth century, it had become a loose confederacy of states. As the Mughal Empire weakened, regional powers began to emerge. These powers included the Marathas, the Rajputs, the Sikhs, and the British East India Company. These regional powers began to challenge the authority of the Mughal Empire and carve out their own independent territories.

The rise of regional powers was another factor in India’s political fragmentation in the mid-eighteenth century. The Marathas, Rajputs, Sikhs, and British East India Company all sought to expand their power and influence. The Marathas, for example, were able to expand their control over much of the Deccan region, while the Rajputs were able to carve out their own independent states in Rajasthan. The Sikhs also established their own independent kingdom in the Punjab, while the British East India Company was able to gain control of large parts of India.

The emergence of new religious and political ideologies was another factor in India’s political fragmentation in the mid-eighteenth century. The rise of Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism challenged the Islamic ideology of the Mughal Empire and further weakened its authority. The Hindu Marathas, in particular, sought to expand their power and influence and challenge the Mughal Empire. The Sikh Khalsa movement also sought to establish an independent Sikh state in the Punjab.

The political fragmentation of India in the mid-eighteenth century had far-reaching consequences. It led to a period of political instability and conflict, as the various regional powers sought to expand their power and influence. It also led to the emergence of new political ideologies and the weakening of the Mughal Empire. This period of political fragmentation ultimately paved the way for the emergence of the British Empire in India.

1. Why did the 'Moderates' fail to carry conviction with the nation about their proclaimed ideology and political goals by the end of the nineteenth century?

```ad-Answer

The failure of the ‘Moderates’ to carry conviction with the nation about their proclaimed ideology and political goals by the end of the nineteenth century can be attributed to a number of factors. Primarily, the ‘Moderates’ were unable to gain the support of the majority of the Indian population due to their lack of commitment to the cause of Indian independence. Despite their claims to be the ‘true nationalists’, they were unwilling to take any concrete steps towards achieving independence. As the Indian National Congress leader, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, lamented, “The Moderates have failed to move the nation.”

The Moderates’ approach to the Indian independence movement was largely characterized by caution and compromise. They believed in working within the existing British colonial system to gradually achieve their goals. This approach was seen as too incremental by many in the Indian population, who were increasingly demanding more radical action. As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, “The Moderates have failed to move the nation because they have not been bold enough in their demands.”

The Moderates’ insistence on non-violence and peaceful protest also failed to inspire the nation. While this approach had been effective in some cases, such as the Indian boycott of British goods, it was seen by many as too passive. The rise of the more radical Indian Nationalists, who advocated for more direct action, such as the use of armed struggle, further undermined the Moderates’ position.

The Moderates’ lack of commitment to the cause of Indian independence was also a major factor in their failure. While they were willing to make some concessions to the British, such as the acceptance of some forms of indirect rule, they were unwilling to push for full independence. This caused them to lose the support of the more radical elements of the Indian population, who viewed them as too conciliatory.

Finally, the Moderates’ failure to address the social and economic issues facing the Indian population also contributed to their downfall. While they had some limited success in achieving certain reforms, such as the repeal of certain discriminatory laws, they failed to address the root causes of poverty and inequality. This caused them to lose the support of the majority of the Indian population, who were increasingly disillusioned with their lack of progress.

In conclusion, the failure of the ‘Moderates’ to carry conviction with the nation about their proclaimed ideology and political goals by the end of the nineteenth century was due to their lack of commitment to the cause of Indian independence, their insistence on non-violent protest and their failure to address the social and economic issues facing the Indian population.
