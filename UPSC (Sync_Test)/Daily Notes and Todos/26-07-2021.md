## Today's academic musings from things studied
1. Decreasing manpower of the army may lead to financial savings but would decrease its role as job provider -> increased pressure from society to increase vacancies.

## Things I learnt today
1.  about Breadcrumbs navigation but could not get it to work
2.  pen and paper studying could really augment no of hours that I put in

## Random thoughts
-  It is better to remain silent than being vocal unecessary
-  Indian Society is one of the most regressive places to live in learn to cope or ignore them
