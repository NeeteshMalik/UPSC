DAY 16/207

## Daily #todo 

- [x] Newspaper
- [x] AL Basham
- [x] Pending CA
- [x] Revision

## Number of Hours pulled 
- 8+ hours studied today

## Daily Thoughts
- Felt I should maybe have a hobby but this might prove counter productive.
- #important Inculcating Luhmann's slip box method/Zettlekasten to UPSC preparation. Taking daily notes from Newspapers to have enough content for contemporary issues and for answer writing.


## What you would like to improve tomorrow?
- Would want to inclulcate better means of study to improve retention and maybe help revise better.
- Need to make some sort of a last read Time and Date tag for when the notes were completely read the last time. For some sort of an Incremental learning idea.
