Day 13/207. ðŸ’ª

## Daily #todo 

- [x] Newspaper
- [x] Pending CA

## Number of Hours pulled 
-  Pulled about 5 hours today. Would like to concentrate more on revision and less on newer sources.  

## Daily Thoughts
- Felt a little anxiety, panicky today while the windows update was going on. Would like to better my biological clock and not sleep in the afternoon.


## What you would like to improve tomorrow?
- Days should not be judged on the basis of the number of hours pulled instead on the quality of time that was spent even if it was less.
