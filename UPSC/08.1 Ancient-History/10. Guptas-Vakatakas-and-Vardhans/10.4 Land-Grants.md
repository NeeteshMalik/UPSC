## Brahmadeyas
-   Confirmed by royal decrees, given for political dimension
-   Feudalism hypothesis says that it was the cause and a symptom of political fragmentation
	-   Why would kings erode their own political power
	-   Period was not of political fragmentation
	-   Was actually given for integrative and legitimizing policies coz Brahmana's enjoyed socio-religious privileged status
	-   Grants were made from lands that made revenue realisation difficult
	-   It did not deplete state resources
	-   Made by powerful kings shows higher level of control over productive resources by the King

    -   Were associated with the royal court

## Land grants as part of larger social and cultural process
-   > BD Chattopadhyay - major historical process was the expansion of state society was through process of local state formation, transformation of tribes into peasants and caste formation, cult appropriation and interaction
-   Strengthened position of Brahmana in rural areas- control over resources, manpower
-   Brah emerged as dominant caste in such villages
-   Tribes were brought under the plough
-   Proliferation of certain castes for ex Kayasthas etc happened
-   Among the Brahmanas themselves hierarchies and regional classification emerged
    -   Integration into local society and tradition led to new cultural changes among them like Payyanur Brahmans of Kerala took matriliny
-   Brahamans merged their activities to the temple milieu - temples emerged as promoters sectarian religion, Sabhas managed temple activities
-   Tribal and Brahmanical cultural interaction ex cult of Jagannatha in Orissa shows Brahmanization of tribal diety, Tantricism

## Ideology 
-   was means of acquiring merit and destroying sin as per Brahmanical texts
-   Various gifts that were mentioned in Smritis and Puranas were food grains, gold, money, cultivable land, plough cows, oxen etc.
-   Temple as an institution gained a more central role in agrarian expansion and land grants were made to temple priests. Earlier only Vedic priests were given.
-   Non Brahmanical religious institutions like the Samghas of Buddhists and Basadis of the Jainas also vied for land grants.
