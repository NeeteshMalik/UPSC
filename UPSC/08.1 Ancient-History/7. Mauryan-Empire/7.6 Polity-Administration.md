### Nature of Mauryan State :
- [x]   #todo 
- Problems with sources 
	- Arthashastra might differ on what is written and the actual way the state was governed.
	- Megasthenes Indica : most of its parts are lost and have several discrepancies and inaccuracies.
	- Ashoka's Inscriptions mostly deal with dhamma and only offere a fleeting, incidental reference to administration
	- To understand the nature of the Mauryan state we need to juxtapose information from these sources into one.
- Question is what sort of an Empire was it? What it meant to be absorbed into the empire? Degrees of Control? How effective was the control?
- Earlier belief that Mauryan empire was highly centralised was not correct.

> Gerard Fussman argued that given the extent of empire and communication of the time Mauryan Empire could not have been centralised.
	> - It was superimposed on various existing political units that enjoyed certain degrees of autonomy.
	> - Ashokas personal supervision applied only to propagation of Dhamma not to details of administration. 

>  Romila Thapar : Initially presented it as a new form of govt marked by centralised control and planning. But subsequently reconsidered it as being culmination of different economies, polities and life-ways.
		> - Empire should be considered as a metropolitan center and peripheral areas. These peripheral areas constituted no of per state societies.
  - Certain new features of Mauryan empire was that they were significantly larger having an imperial ideology and vision. Its emperors were not insular or inward looking but looked beyond the limits of the subcontinent.
  -  Arthashastra was 1st to define a state. Its concept of saptanga rajya considers tate as consisting of 7 inter related limbs.
  - King was the central figures and focus of power. Mentioning him as Devampiya and Piyadasi meant suggests linking of gods and kings.
  - Arthshastra emphaises moral obligation of kingship by elaborating the Kings duties and obligations. 
  - Ashokas ideas of Kingship partially mathces that mentioned in the Arthashastra.
