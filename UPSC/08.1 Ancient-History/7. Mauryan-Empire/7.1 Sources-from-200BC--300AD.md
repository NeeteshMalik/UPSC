####    IN divided into 7 classes (CASO FPS)

-   Farmers - numerous, regarded as public benefactors, protected from injury
-   Shepherds and hunters - live in tents, pay taxes from their animals
-   Artisans and Traders - perform public duties, pay tax, make weapons
-   Soldiers - enjoy greatest freedom, devoted solely to mil activities
-   Overseers - supervise everything, report to king,
-   Councillors and assessors - who are engaged in public affairs, is the smallest class but most respected. They are advisors to the king, army generals chief magistrates, supervisors for agricultural works. 

### Critical Analysis of Megasthenes
-   Socially geographically restricted, 7 fold division did not correspond to varnas or Jatis
-   Idealised India - farmers never touched in war etc
-   Later interpolation does not make sense is untrue/ exaggerated
	-   Ex Diodorous - one horned horses, river on which nothing floats, strange customs, men w/ dog heads, gold digging ants
