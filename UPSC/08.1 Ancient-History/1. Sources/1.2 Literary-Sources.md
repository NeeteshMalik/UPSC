[1996, 60m]
 
	-   Marxist scholars like R.S.Sharma, BNS Yadav and the likes view early medieval polity as one of decentralization and disintegration and the emergence and crystallisation of Indian feudalism.
	-   Feudalism debate in Indian context started by Col. James Todd seeing it as a lord vassal relationship
	-   D D Kosmabi gave feudalism a significant place in the context of socio-economic history in his book An Introduction to the Study of Indian History as the land grants increased so did the no of landlords from villages and towns
	-   RS Sharma has shown that the decline in trade and commerce and the deurbanisation and the fall of the gupta empire, debasement of coins all led to the inc in land grants and thereby feudalism during this time. He refined his views in his paper How Feudal was Indian Feudalism? to include the economic and social crises.
	-   D.N.Jha has conc on the cultural and ideological dimensions for the rise of feudalism in his The Feudal order in his book The Feudal Order
	-   In the reconstruction of early medieval polity 3 models are at present accepted :
		-   unitary, centrally organized kingdom with a strong central bureaucracy
		-   Indian Feudalism model of decentralized feudal states
		-   model of a segmentary state
	-   KN Sastri has shown that the Chola state was a juxtaposition of a powerful central monarchy and local administrative bodies.
	-   Burton Stein located the segmentary polity from Pallava times and has shown the difference b/w ritual sovereignty and actual political control.
