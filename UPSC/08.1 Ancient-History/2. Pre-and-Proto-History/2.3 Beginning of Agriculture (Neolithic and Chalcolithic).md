Q. Explain the meaning of the word Protohistory in various contexts?
- Europeans : People who did not themselves have **writing** but are mentioned in **written texts**. 
- India : Refers to Harappan period and from 1500-500 BCE during which only literature was orally transmitted.
- Archaeologist : refers to period b/w beginning of food production and advent of Iron Tech include Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures
- beginning of double cropping can be traced at sites like **Pirak** in Baluchistan.
- Multiple cropping was carried out in the **Kachi** plain, Gujarat and Maharahstra.

## Neolithic
-  origins of agriculture and beginnings of domestication of animals. Transformation from hunting and gathering to sedentary farming leading to village settlements and manufacturing of new type of tools was called as neolithic age.
-   Term was coined by Sir John Lubbock in his book Prehistoric Times it meant where stones were more skilfully made. Later **V. Gordon Childe defined the Neolithic-Chalcolithic culture as a self- sufficient food producing economy**
-   Features of this age were - Practice of **agriculture, Domestication of animals, Grinding polishing of stone tools** (most essential characterstic of Neo culture), and also the **manufacture of pottery**
-   6000 BC began Neolithic and as late as 1000BC in south and Eastern IN
-   Used polished stone tools
-   Produced Ragi and Horsegram, later rice wheat and barley
-   Hand made potter in early phase, later in

### Beginning of Neolithic age in and around the world
-   areas of **wadi Kubbaiya, Wadi Tuska, Kom Umbo** near the Nile valley have given the earliest evidences of cultivation of barley and wheat.
-   Not all the sites were neolithic sites some may have preceded neolithic culture. Domestication of animal also came after food cultivation. Thus it can be said that domestication of plants did not originate in West Asia
-   **farming began in Palestine, Syria and Turkey** in the 9th millennium B.C.
-   Between 8500-7500 B.C. **Jericho in Palestine** became large village where agriculture is evidenced but there is **no evidence of animal domestication**. It was a **fortified** settlement.
-   **Catal Huyuk in Southern Turkey** was a large village. Here wheat, barley and peas were grown. Animals like cattle, sheep and goat were domesticated. Wall murals in mud houses can also be seen.
-   In Iraq at **Jarmo** there is also evidence of permanently established farming villages I (6500-5800 B.C.) with about 20 to 30 mud houses
-   In Iran farming began in the region of **Khuzistan** during eight millennium B.C., almost I the same time as in Palestine and Anatolia.
-   At Ali Kosh in South Iran (from about I 7,500 B.C.) we have the evidence of a winter camp


### Neolithic sites in the Sub Continent
-   Neo levels **Mehrgarh** classified into two phases, (i) early **aceramic** w/o pottery and (ii) the later phase
-   domestication of sheep goat done locally. beginning of the pre-pottery settlement phase has been fixed to about 6000 B.C.
-   rectangular houses of mud-bricks some structures were which were used for storage
-   N culture of Burzahom displays affinities w/ Sarai Khola, Ghaligai of Swat valley in pottery, bone and stone objects. Pit dwellings, harvesters and dog burials are characteristics of the North Chinese Neolithic culture. Contact with the pre-Harappans is also indicated by the pottery found at Burzahom
-   relevant excavated sites of the Belan Valley which indicate transition from the food-gathering stage to the food producing stage are Chopani-Mando, Koldihawa and Mahagara.
-   Chopani-Mando provides the **earliest evidence of the use of pottery** in the world.
-   Neolithic culture of South India has been placed between 2600 and 1000 B.C.
-   **Millet** (Ragi) was one of the earliest crops cultivated by the Neolithic farmers of South India. Other crops were wheat, horsegram, and moong (green gram).
-   at Nagarjunakonda that domestication of plants preceded the domestication of animals
-   No neolithic phase has been found in the upper reaches of the Krishna and the Godavari and their tributaries and But the evidence from Chandoli on the Bhima, a tributary of the Krishna and from Nevasa and Daimabad suggest they moved to chalcolithic phase.
-   Only a few neolithic sites have been found in n the Tapti and Narmada valleys of north Maharashtra, MP and Gujarat.

## Chalcolithic

- Chalcolithic cultural sequence in doab includes late Harappan phase, the **OCP culture**, Copper Hoards and **Black and Red Ware BRW** phase
- 1800 - 1000/800 BC
-   Used small tools esp stone blade, situated closer to hills
-   BRW wheel made, linear designs
-   Channel spouted pots, dishes and bowls on stand
-   Bajra, Lentil, Black gram, green gram, grass pea, cotton, ragi, bajra
-   Mud brick houses, wattle daub,
-   Jorwe culture - nucleated settlements,
-   Village economy
-   first to use painted pottery
-   Burials in Maharashtra in North South position, in South in East West
-   Limitations - Burials had large no of children, rural background, supply of metal was limited, no writing, did not benefit from IVC
-   Concentrated on the Ganga Yamuna doab, Ochre coloured pottery found, Anthropomorphic figures in Khetri mines

 
## PYQs
