-   Tungabhadra natural boundary fertile rice growing region, high land revenue, prestige, political supremacy -> this is the reason *Why?* hostility started b/w Pallavas and Chalukyas.

-   *Paramesvara Varman I won against Chalukyas* - Udayendram Plates
- *Chalukya king Vikramaditya II in 733 AD is said to have run over Kanchi for over 3 times*. Pallavas were completely routed and were no longer a threat. A century later they were wiped out by the Cholas.
