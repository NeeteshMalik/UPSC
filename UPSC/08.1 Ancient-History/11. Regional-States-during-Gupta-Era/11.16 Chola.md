#### Segmentary State Theory
-   Unitary state - is where there is central monopoly of power exercised by a specialised administration staff
-   Segmentary state - political power is exercised within a pyramidal series of segments
    -   Territorial sovereignty is limited
    -   Around periphery centre exercises limited control
    -   Peripheries are subordinate foci of power
    -   They are flexible, fluctuating, changing their allegiance from time to time
    -   Burton Stein added to this
        -   Segmentary state is dual consisting of political control and ritual sovereignty RS
        -   Multiple centres of source of RS

### Nature of South Indian States 
-   KAN Sastri has portrayed the Chola state as highly centralised in order to glorify and has nationalistic tinge

#### Burton Stein criticised this 'traditional historiography'
-   did not relate the state to society and economy, especially the agrarian order
-   Centralised Chola state and strong local self-governing institution was counter intuitive/ inconsistent
-   A/C to him the fault was in characterisation of state
-   Steins model is based on sacral kingship, segmentary state, peasant society and peasant state
-   King's power was confined to central areas and outside it was only a ritual figure
-   Land revenue limited and revenue depended mainly on looting expeditions
-   Denied the existence of Chola bureaucratic machinery to control local administration
-   Also denied existence of Chola standing army - mil function was distributed among peasantry, merchants etc
-   Thus it was not a centralised state

#####    Problems with Steins theory
-   By calling kingship as purely sacral he has denied all military achievements
-   As per him all military expedition were cattle raids
-   War and loot was part but the persistence of empires like Maurya, Gupta, Satavahana, Cholas etc suggests more than mere cattle raids
-   Some adm and revenue structure did exist to mobilise people to wage war
-   Various Chola inscriptions refer to administrative offices and attempts were made to centralise adm
-   Was an increased involvement of king in passing orders and officials reached out to villages to carry out orders
-   Existence of corporate village org did not mean that they exercised political power at higher levels
-   Other Models are
    -   Feudalism model
    -   Mode of production and link b/w land, labour and state structure


## Economy

**Role of Nadus and Nagarams in the process of Urbanisation** 
- This process of urbanisation during the chola period was essentially reurbanisation brought about by agrarian expansion and organisation of peasants in micro regions like Nadu.
- This allowed the Chola country to have a big agrarian base and large surpluses that were redirected towards other sectors of economy -> led to dev of trade organisations such as the Ayyavole.
- These market centres called Nagaram prolifereated significantly under the Chola rule. They were points of exchange.
- Many of such centres were founded by Royal sanction and suffixes like pura or pattana was used.
- Nagarams located at the intersection of regional trade developed into large towns. Ex Manigramam, Anjuvannam.
- These nagarams linked the ports with political and administrative centers, and with craft centers of the interior.
- They enabled the movt of long distance trade.
- Specialisation in marketing and trade let to emergence of organisations sucha s Saliya nagaram ie weavers cum traders, Sankarappadi nagaram or oil mongers cum traders and Paraga nagaram or foreign traders.

**Critical Analysis of their Rule**
- [x]   #todo 
- Chola polity was ritualistic in nature. The rulers had to constantly participate in events that legitimised their rule as upholders of the Brahmanical cosmic order.
- This long term support to ritualisation, temple making put the priest class into a privileged position that continued later on.
-  This also meant that secular literature and secular education such as science and medicine was neglected.
-  The tradition of female dancers in temples as devadasis emerged who later became one of the most abused classes in south Indian society who were often sold into prostitution.
- Chola warfare into Ceylon was a part of their economic activity brought lot of death and destruction into the island and other neighbouring dynasties. However this was a common occurence in medieval kingdoms.
