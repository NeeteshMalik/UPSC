The Early Vedic period, also known as the Rigvedic period, is characterized by a relatively egalitarian society, where individuals were free to pursue their own goals and where social distinctions were based on merit rather than birth. It was also marked by absence of Gender based discrimination and Women enjoyed a significant postion in society. On the other hand, the Later Vedic period, which is marked by the emergence of the other three Vedas, the society underwent significant changes and the egalitarian character of the early Vedic society was altered.

One of the main elements of continuity between the Early and Later Vedic cultures is the presence of the Vedic religion. The Vedic religion, which is based on the worship of natural forces and elements, remained a fundamental aspect of both societies. However, during the Later Vedic period, there was an evolution of religious beliefs and practices, with the emergence of a more complex pantheon of gods and goddesses, and the introduction of new religious practices such as the use of fire sacrifices and the performance of elaborate rituals.

Another element of continuity is the presence of the Vedas themselves, which remained an important source of religious and cultural knowledge throughout both periods. The Vedas were considered sacred texts and were passed down from generation to generation.

In terms of changes, one of the main elements of change between the Early and Later Vedic cultures is the emergence of a caste system. The Rigveda makes no mention of caste distinctions, but by the time of the later Vedas, the caste system had become an integral part of society. This system was based on the belief that individuals were born into a certain caste based on the actions of their ancestors and that they were destined to remain in that caste for their entire lives. This change in society's organization was reflected in the religious texts of later Vedic period, where the Brahmins, who were the priests and scholars, came to hold a position of great prestige and power.

As far as the varna division are concerned, they became entrenched into religion. The four fold varna system with the Brahmanas on top was soldified as more religious texts were written during the time. This varna division was rigid and based on birth. 

Another significant change was the emergence of a powerful and centralized state. The early Vedic society was primarily made up of small, autonomous villages, but during the later Vedic period, large kingdoms and empires emerged. This is reflected in the later Vedas, which contain references to powerful kings and their armies, as well as to large cities and urban centers. The kings were often seen as divine figures, and the state became an important religious institution. This change in political organization led to the emergence of a ruling class, which came to hold significant power and wealth. 

Cattle raids now became full fledged wars as the Rulers and the ruled became more conscious about the territory they lived in. Concept of private property started to develop.
