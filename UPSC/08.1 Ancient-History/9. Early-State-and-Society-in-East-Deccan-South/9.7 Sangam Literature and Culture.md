The Sangam culture refers to the Iron Age culture of Southern India, particularly in the southernmost parts of the Indian subcontinent, including present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The period is known to scholars as the Sangam Era of Tamil literature, which is generally dated to the late centuries BCE to early centuries CE. Archaeologically, this period corresponds to the Chalcolithic and early Iron Age periods of South India.

This Iron Age culture is postulated to have been the source of the development of Dravidian culture in general, and the Tamil language in particular. The most comprehensive source of information about the Sangam period is the corpus of Sangam literature comprised of 2,381 poems in Tamil composed by 473 poets, some with their patron kings named. These poems are classified under seven known anthologies and are generally divided into the Eighteen Greater Texts and the Ten Idylls or Lesser Texts.

Other sources of information about this era include archaeological data such as excavations around the modern cities of Chennai and Kaveri River valley. Graeco-Roman sources such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and Strabo‚Äôs Geography, as well as the writings of various Roman historians, including Pliny, Plutarch, Dionysius and Tacitus, are also important sources of information about the Sangam period. This period was also when the Indian Bhagavata, Jaina, and Pancharatra religious philosophies were gaining prominence in the southern part of India, which may have been further influenced by early Buddhist ideas coming from what is now Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand. 

The art, architecture, and coins of this period also provide important clues about the nature of the Sangam culture. Coins of this period often bear symbols, such as the bull, fish, and thunderbolt, that are still used as symbols of Dravidian culture today. In addition, cave paintings from the Vijayanagara period (13th to 17th centuries) depict figures that reflect the style of the early Sangam period. 

The archaeological data from the Sangam age have also revealed several artifacts, including tools and pottery from residential sites, graves, and storage pits, as well as seals and figurines of horses and warriors, which provide valuable insights into the social, religious, and cultural life of this period.
