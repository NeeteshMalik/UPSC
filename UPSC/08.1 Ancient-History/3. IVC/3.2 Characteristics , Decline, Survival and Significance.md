    -   **Uniformity in materials** like bricks

    -   Shortughai as trade site

    -   Artefacts are distributed equally at sites
    -   Precious/ semi percious metals stones discovered in small villages

## Decline
-   Cities like Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Kalibangan experienced gradual decline in urban planning and construction. Houses were being made of old bricks, construction of them encroached streets and were haphazard in shape. Cities were turning into slums.
-   Entry points to Mohenjodaro's Great bath was blocked and later it and the granary fell into disuse.
-   Distinct reduction in the-number of sculptures, figurines, beads, bangles and inlay works was seen.
-   Harappa was marked by the arrival of a new group of people marked by their burial practice called the Cemetery H culture.
-   The population and the settlements around the core area of Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Bahawalpur decreased but those around areas of Gujarat, East Punjab, Haryana and upper Doab increased. This could have been due to emigration of people from the core region.
-   writing, uniform weights, Harappan pottery and architectural style had disappeared.
-   Mesopotamian literature stops referring to Meluhha by the end of 1900 B.C.


### Theories of Sudden Decline 

####  Floods and Earthquakes 
- In Mohenjodaro various periods of occupation were separated by **evidences of deep flooding** and **clayey silt** as high as 80 feet.
- R. Sutlej could have changed its course or due to the sudden rise in Arabian sea coastline

##### R.L. Raikes catastrophic flooding 
-  prolonged submergence of cities around Indus
-   earthquakes/tectonic movts raised level of flood plains in lower Indus level Leading to the formation of lake swallowed Mohenjodaro
-   coastal town hampered due tectonic movements

##### H.T. Lambrick 
- river would be dammed in such a manner by tectonic uplifts is incorrect because
-   large water of Indus could have easily breached the bund created by an earthquake.
-   deposition of silt might not have been the result of flooding.
-   fails to explain decline outside the Indus valley

#### Barbarian Invasions 
- Ramparasad Chanda 1926 and Mortimer Wheeler 1947 were proponents
- Wheeler believed that the Harappan civilization was destroyed by the Aryan invaders.
-   Late Phases at Mohenjodaro has evidences of Massacre. Rig Veda mentions the destruction of fortresses of Dasas and Dasyus and Indra has been called as Purandhara or the destroyer of forts.
-   the Rig Veda mentions a place called Hariyupiya identified as Harappa on the banks of river Ravi.
-   Aryans on the other hand are believed to have arrived here not earlier than a period around 1500 B.C whereas Harappa decline in 1800 BC.
    -   massacre could have been caused by bandits from hilly regions.

### Theories of Gradual Decline
-   **Mohenjodaro** and **Dholavira** give a picture of gradual decline while at Kalibangan and Banawali life ended all of a sudden
-   overlap b/w late Harappan and PGW culture at sites like **Bhagwanpura** and **Dadheri** in Haryana and Katpalon and Nagar in Punjab.
-   overlap b/w Harappan and OCP levels in **Bargaon** and **Ambakheri** in Western UP.

#### Shifting away of the Indus 
- A/C to Lambrick the change of course was the reason for decline.
-   Shift led to dec in food production and water, silt was result of wind deposition and from the decaying of bricks
-   does not explain the decline of other settlements
-   People of Mohenjodaro could have easily moved towards the changed course of the river.

#### Increased Aridity and Drying Up of the Ghaggar 
- >was put forward by D.P. Agarwal and Sood.
-   dec in moisture water availability. In semi-arid regions of Harappa this could create a major disaster.
-   tectonic disturbance - to change in course of Ghaggar's tributaries Sutlej and Yamuna
-   difficult to date drying of river, more info required

#### Ecological Imbalance 
-   >**Fairservis** is a proponent of this. A/C to him the delicate ecological balance of these semi-arid areas disturbed due to human cattle popu in these areas was fast depleting the scanty forests, food and fuel resources
-   caused increase in floods and droughts in an already semi-arid precarious area and completed by raids from surrounding areas
-   fertility of soil in the subsequent periods did not decrease
-   More information would be required to calculate subsistence of H

### Man Made Reasons for Decling
-   What man made reasons could have been the cause of decline of H. civ?
    -   Over **cultivation** 
    -   Over **grazing**
    -   Deforestation for fuel and farming

## Survival 
-   >**Malik and Possehl** focused their attention on various aspects of continuity of the Harappan tradition
-   Jhukar pottery in use in Amri, Chanhudaro, Jhukar etc have shown similarity to the Mature Harappan pottery.
-   Metal objects here have shown contact with central asian and Iranian influences vzi axes, copper pins, shaft hole etc and circular stamp seals.
-   Indo Iranian borderlands show the used of copper stand seals and copper shaft hole axes in sites like Mundigak, Nausharo and Pirak indicating contact with Iran
-   In Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana sites like Mitathal, Bara, Ropar and Siswal have shown Ochre coloured pottery.
-   In Kutch and Saurashtra places like Rangapur and Somnath have shown continuity in ceramic traditions.
-   These harappan settlements would have merged with the regional and local settlements of the area and slowly the regional cultures of pottery etc replaced the Harappan ones.
-   The cults of Pasupati (Siva) and of the mother goddess and phallic worship seem to have come down to us from the Harappan tradition.
-   the cult of sacred places, rivers or trees and sacred animals show a distinct continuity in the subsequent historic civilization of India. The evidence of fire worship and sacrifice in Kalihgan and Lothal is significant
-   traditional weight and currency system of India, based on a ratio of sixteen as the unit, was already present in the Harapp civilization
-   techniques Bf making potter's wheel in modern India is similar to those used by the Harappans
-   Bullock carts and boats used in modem India were already present in the Harappan cities


## Significance
- [x] #todo 
- Its significance would be unique features of Society, Polity, Economy and Art and Culture and their continuity seen today in the Modern world.
