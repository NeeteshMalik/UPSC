###  Shivaji
- After the treaty of 1636 of Bijapur with the Mughals Shahji was sent to Bangalore where he tried to set up and independent principality.
- He left his Poona jagir to Shivaji and by the age of 18 he ran over many forts such as poona Rajgarh, Kondana and Torna  in 1647 he got full control of this fathers jagir.
-  Poona was a neglected Jagir and Shah Jahan was busy in Central Asia -> him trying to carve out an independent principality.
- His real conquest started in 1656 when he conquered Javli from Maratha Chief Chandra Rao More. This freed up his path to Satara and to the coastal strip.
- He came into conflict with Mughals after 1657 after they invaded Bijapur. His frequent shift of alliance made Aurangzeb suspicious who wanted him to be employed in Karnataka.
- Shivaji demanded a mansab of 5000 and the deshmukhi of Junna and Ahmadnagar since his father Shahji was captured by the Mughals. But Shahji was released soon after.
- Shivaji was called in 1657 after the Invasion of Bijapur. Before this he had captured Bhiwandi and Kalyan in North Konkan. 
- Bijapur wanted him to be captured. Afzal Khan set up a meeting with him promising him to get pardoned at the Bijapuri court.  But Shivaji knew of this and in 1659 murdered the Khan. He then routed the leaderless army.
-  His exploits were widely spoken of and he was said to have magical powers. It made him a legendary figure.
- Shaista Khan's army took control of North Deccan in 1660. 
- In 1662 Shivaji made a deal with Bijapur to secure his north west part of Kingdom. 
- After this he infiltrated into the camp of Shaista Khan and attacked him in his haram killing his son and one of his captains. In 1664 he attacked Surat, premier Mughal court.

#### Treaty of Purandhar and Shivaji's Visit to Agra, Difficulties faced by Shivaji
- After Shaista Khan debacle Mirza Raja Jai Singh was trusted to put down Shivaji  and given wide powers.
- Jai Singh tried to isolate Shivaji appealing to all nobles. He then besieged Purandhar where Shivaji had lodged his family in 1665. After which Shivaji opened negotiation.

The following terms were agreed :
1. Out of 35 forts 23 forts that yielded a revenue of 4 lakh hurts every year was to be surrendered to Mughals. 
2. Bijapuri territory encompassing Konkan and Balaghat was given to him.

- Shivajit was taken into Mughal services and asked to lead against Bijapur. This was a plan by Jai Singh to keep him occupied and if he digresses from the plan defeat him.
- Shivaji failed in the Seige of Panhala and so did Jai Singh's plan of capturing Bijapur. This failure was alluded to Shivaji's treachery after which he was sent to reconcile with Aurangzeb.
- Aurangzeb granted him a mansab of 5000 zat that was earlier given to his minor son. It was clear that Aurangzeb did not value Shivaji's friendship. A did not even speak to him in person Shivaji felt insulted and stormed out after refusing imperial service. Many argued exemplary punishment be given to Shivaji but before any decision was to be made Shivaji escaped from detention.
- Later Shivaji asked for Emperors pardon and entered into a treaty with him where Sambhaji was restored to mansab of 5000 and jagir in Berar.

- Shivaji's organisation of Army and revenue system was the more important that his appt of these officials.
- Preferred to give cash salaries to regular soldiers sometimes chiefs received revenue grants called saranjam.
- No women or dancing girls were allowed to accompany the army, strict discipline was maintained.
- Plunder taken by soldiers was strictly accounted. 
- Regular army had about 30-40 thousand cavalry supervised by havaldars who had fixed salaries.
- Forts were major source of strengths and carefully supervised. Mavali foot soldiers and gunners were appointed there. 3 men of each ranks were put incharge of each fort to guard against treachery.

- His navy had 60-160 gunboats aka ghurabs and other ships such as Shibars, Manchwas etc mainly used for trading. 
- For sea faring he inducted Kolis and Bhandaris and also the Muslims aka Malabar pirates.

 **Revenue System**
 - Largely based on Malik Ambar's system. Shivaji tried to estd links with village headmen to measure the land. 
 - Due to neglect bigger deshmukhs had become very powerful in the area. A/c Sabhasad a contemporary historian Deshmukhs had become unruly and seized the country.
 - Shiva as per Sabhasad destroyed the bastions of the Desais, their castles and strongholds and posted his own men. 
- He prohibited the illegal exactions of mirasdars and put a stop to ijara or revenue farming and fixed the dues of zamindars from villages in cash and grains.
- His efforts were to reform the existing system not to create a new one.
- Sabhasad says that revenue demand was 2/5 of actual produce. Fraser says that it was double the rate of former days. Demand must have been heavy.
- Shivaji supplemented his income by levying Chauth/ Chauthai from neighbouring Mughal territories.
	- Chauth was not a new feature but Zamindars in Guj had been charging Banth that was 1/4 of revenue in areas of control.
	- It was done by Portuguese, Zamindars of Deccan etc. 
	- In practice it became a protection money against Maratha depredations.
- Another claim based on zamindari rights was Shivajis claim of Sardeshmukhi since it was based on the notion that Shivaji was head of all deshmukhs in the Area.
- His officials and commanders were drawn strictly from Maharashtra
