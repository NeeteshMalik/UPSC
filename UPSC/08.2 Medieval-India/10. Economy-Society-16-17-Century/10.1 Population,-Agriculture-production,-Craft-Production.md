##  Population 
-   Moreland made the first attempt to estimate the population with the help of the data of the Ain i Akbari. He compared the the extent arazi (gross cropped area) to the size of the population. He concluded 30 to 40 million people lived at the end of the 16th century.
-   He calculated the population of the Deccan from the military strength taking the ratio as 1:30 b/w soldiers and civilians. Estimating the population at 30mil.
-   His estimates were flawed b/coz arazi did not include fallow, uncultivable waste land etc. Taking the ratio was also arbitrary as they could vary.
-   Irfan habib and Shireen moosvi have covered other aspects missing in Morelands classifcation and concluded that the population in 17th century to be 140-150 mil. And that of Akbars Empire as 100mil
-   Ashok Desai has used the statistics of consumption in 1960s to calculated level of consumption in 1595. He compared the purchasing power of the lowest urban wages on basis of prices given in Ain to all India average prices in 1960s which was 1/5th of what it was in 1960s.
-   It has been criticized for using modern statistical data to compare 15th century data. The price and wages in Ain considers only areas around Delhi and Lahore.
-   the compound annual rate of growth of the country's population for the period 1601 to 1872 was 0.21% per annum. It suggest that the growth rate of Indian population was not sluggish.
