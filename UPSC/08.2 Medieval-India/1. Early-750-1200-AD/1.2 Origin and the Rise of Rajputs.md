-   Lack of strategic insights among the Rajputs - no anti turk alliance formed due to lack of political unity and absence of dominant power in NW India
-   Successors of Ghazni were always on the offensive
-   Inferior org + leadership, no unified command, slow moving ex Elephants,
-   Agility and mobility of Turkic warriors, accustomed to maintaining large armies, Troops paid in cash, Iqta system
-   Slave system gave them loyal, able bodies men who were great commanders
-   Samanta systems/ Feudatories - hereditary wanted to get independent, difficult to control vis a vis Centralised system of Turks, Iqtas not hereditary
-   KS Lambden - Patriotism not known among Central Asians, Sultan expected them to pay taxes did not receive loyalty from common man.
-   Rajput loyalty towards caste, clan, village, city to defence of home
-   Greater social mobility among Turks, R had untouchability concept
