-   Ethical Issues in IN civil services
    -   Corruption both institutional and individual, Assymetric distribution of power, lack of accountability,
    -   lack of integrity, lack of action against corrupt officials, lack of protection to whistle blowers,
    -   lack of proper code of conduct for Public Servants, lack transparency
-   Per 2nd ARC
    -   Corruption, lack of commitment, Red-tapism, Govt servants rarely held accountable, bureaucratic apathy, frequent transfers, unholy nexus b/w unscrupulous politicians and bureaucrats
-   Value Conflicts - individuals or group hold strong personal beliefs that are in disagreement within themselves
    -   Ex efforts to promote equal opportunity result in conflict among values viz efficiency, justice, equality etc
    -   Crime prevention might concern liberty, due process, equity etc
-   Framework of Ethical Behaviour -
    -   Codify ethical norms, counter conflict of interest, create mechanism for enforcing codes, providing norms for qualifying disqualifying public functionary
-   Philosophy of Public Interest -
    -   Intuitionist philosophy - justifies existing practices
    -   Perfectionism - favours excellence over social equality
    -   Utilitarianism
    -   Theory of Justice - John Rawls liberty should be equally given to all, public offices should be open to all
    -   Human Rights - inalienable FR to every Human, equal and non-discriminatory
    -   Egalitarianism - all humans are equal in worth and social status
-   Ethical Dilemma
    -   Choice b/w competing sets of principles
        -   1st type of dilemma is when agent must make a decision
        -   2nd is when chose from actions
        -   3rd any action take would compromise some or the other ethical principle, no perfect soln
    -   Types of ED
        -   Personal cost ED
        -   Right versus Right ED - open/transparent vs oath of secrecy
        -   Conjoint ED - combination of above written Eds
    -   Examples - blowing whistles against corruption of senior officers; actively engage in pressure groups or party politics
    -   Resolve -
        -   Action is legal/ consistent w/ Gov policy
        -   In line w/ my agency's goals and Code of Conduct
        -   Is it the right thing to do
        -   What could be the outcome
        -   Can I justify doing it
        -   What would happen during public scrutiny
