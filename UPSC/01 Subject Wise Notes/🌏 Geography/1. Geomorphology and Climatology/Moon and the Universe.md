## Origin of Earth - Theories
-   Nebular hypothesis - by Immanuel Kant revised by Laplace : planets were formed out of a cloud
-   Binary theory - by **Chamberlain and Moulton** : **wandering star came near** formation of **cigar shaped extension** separated and condensed to form planets

### Modern Theories
-	Big Bang Theory was first proposed by Georges Lemaitre in 1931.
    -   All matter in **one tiny ball**
    -   exploded **13.7 bil** years ago -> first atoms.
    -   Temp dropped - atomic matter
    -   universe became transparent.
-   **Hoyles's concept of steady state** : Universe roughly the same at any point in time

### Formation of Stars and Planets
-   Stars are formed by localised clumps in a Nebula
-   Stages in the development of planets are :
    -   core of a nebula becomes surrounded by a **rotating disc of gas and dust** due to gravitational force
    -   cloud condenses -> round objects planetisimals
    -   Which come together to form planets
-   1st 4 planets are Terrestrial and others called Jovian/Gas Giant

| Jovian                                   | Terrestrial                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Core is denser                           | Core not dense                           |
| Spin more and are flattened at the poles | Spin less hence poles are less flattened |
| more moons                               | less                                     |
| Have mostly H2 and He in atmosphere                    | Have CO2 and N2                                     |

#### Moon
- **Dumb bell theory by George Darwin** - Earth expelled a piece of its mass
-   large body collided into Earth and formed the Moon was the **Big Splat Theory**
-   **Moon Craters** created by 2 processes : **volcanism** and **cratering**.
	-   largest - South-Pole Aitkin basin.
-   lack water, atmosphere and techtonic plates reason for little erosion.
