## Running Water

When rivers reach maturity in lower slopes, lateral erorsion causes flat low relief plain called peneplaing, the other formation is a Monadnock. 
-   Isolated hill of bedrock standing above the general level is called a **Monadnock**, aka inselberg. 
![[Landforms-image1-00085771.jpg]]
-   Low-relief plain formed by protracted erosion is called Peneplain. ![[Landforms-image2-00085771.jpg]]

### Characterstics of various Stages of Rivers
- Youth  
	- **V shaped valleys**, **Waterfalls**, **Rapids**, Interlocking spurs, Potholes, 
	- Meanders can also exist but not widely present
	- Vertical erosion causes **steep sides and narrow frills** to form V Shaped valleys
- Mature 
	- Floodplains, deep V shaped valleys, strean divides become sharp
	- Swamps and Marshes of Y stage disappear 
- Old  
	- Vast **Floodplains**, **Ox bow lakes**, Deltas, Natural Levees

### Running Water Erosional Landforms

- Valleys
	- Start as rills -> gullies -> valleys
	- V-shaped, Gorge, Canyon are types
	-  Deep valleys with steep to straight sides they are formed in hard rocks called gorges. 
	![[Landforms-image14-00085771.jpg]]
	-  Gorge that have steep step like slope are canyons 
		-  wider at the top than at bottom and forms on sedimentary rocks

- Potholes and Plungepools
	- Circular depressions formed in rocky beds of hill streams through stream erosion and abrasion of rocks are called Potholes. 
	![[Landforms-image15-00085771.jpg]]
-  Series of potholes is a plungepool, formed due to constant rotation of boulders and impact of water within a pothole 
![[Landforms-image3-00085771.jpg]]
- Incised/Entrenched Meanders
	-   When meanders form in hard rocks they are called Incised or entrenched meanders   
- River Terraces
	-    Formed due to vertical erosion by the stream into its own depositional floodplain 
	![[Landforms-image12-00085771.jpg]]
	- When river terraces occur on either side they are called Paired terraces

### Running Water Depositional Landforms
-   Alluvial Fans 
	- formed at foot slope of low gradient when load becomes too heavy for streams to carry 
	- **cone shaped deposit** 
	- forms many distributaries
-   Deltas  
	-   Similar to Alluvial fans but form at mouths of river. 
	-   Well sorted with clear stratification - coarser material settles first finer ones carried to sea
-   Floodplains 
	-   formed when water spills over the banks and deposits silt and clay
	-   When they are above the banks called inactive floodplain.
	-   contain 2 types of deposit : flood and channel deposits.
	-   Natural Levees. 
		-   **Low linear and parallel ridges of coarse deposits** along the banks of river are called 
		![[Landforms-image4-00085771.jpg]]
	-   Point Bars aka Meander **Bars found in concave side of ox bow** lakes are sediments deposited in*linear fashion* along banks contains *mixed size of sediments* 
-   Meander  
	-   Formed due to lateral erosion of streams flowing over gentle slope common in flood and delta plains 
	![[Landforms-image11-00085771.jpg]]
	-   not a **landform** but  a type of **channel pattern** formed due to :
		-   Lateral erosion in gentler slopes
		-   unconsolidate alluvial deposits exerting lateral pressure
		-   coriolis force acting

## Groundwater 

### Groundwater Erosional Landforms  

-   Karst topography 
	-   formed **underground** due to **dissolution of sloluble rocks** viz limestone, dolomite, gypsum etc 
	-   characterised by sinkholes and caves. <br> ![[Pasted image 20210526183335.png|500]]
	-   Swallow holes 
		-   Small to medium sized *round to sub rounded shallow depressions* 
		-   formed on the **surface of limestones**  
	-   **Sinkholes** 
		-   openings circular at  top and funnel shaped towards bottom  
		-   connected to a cave/roof of a void at the bottom 
		-   may collapse forming **dolines**
	-   Uvalas   
		-   **Closed Karst depressions** 
		-   formed when sink holes and dolines join together because of slumping of materials along the margins or due to roof collapse.
- Lapies or Karren or Ridges 
	- **Irregular, grooved, ridge like features** in an open limestone field 
	- formed ***due to solution activity*** along parallel and sub parallel*joints* 
	- eventually transform into limestone pavements
- Caves
	- formed when water percolates and dissolves limestones
	- Cave w/ openings on both sides called tunnels

### Groundwater Depositional Landforms
-   **Stalacites** hang like icicles in caves they drip to form **Stalgamites** at  bottom.  
-   Eventually both join to form pillars and columns

## Glaciers
- Piedmont glacier 
	-   **valley glacier** that spilled onto relatively flat plains ![[Landforms-image5-00085771.jpg]]
#### Glacier Erosional Landforms
-   Cirques 
	-   bowl-shaped, deep, long and wide depressions that glaciers carve into mountains and valley sidewalls at high elevations. 
	-   Lakes can form at such places they are called cirque or tarn lakes.
-   Horns 
	-   formed when 3 or more radiating glaciers cut headward until their cirques meet.
-   Serrated/Saw Toothed Ridges
	- divide between cirques or head walls get narrow and turn into Serrated or saw tooth ridges aka **Aretes.** 
	![[Landforms-image13-00085771.jpg|300x300]]
-   Glacial Valleys/ Troughs
	-   U Shaped w/ broad floors, smooth and steep sides
	-   may contain Moraines
	-   Fjords are Deep glacial troughs filled with sea water making up the shorelines.

#### Glacier Depositional Landorms

-    **Glacial tills - unassorted, coarse and fine debris** dropped by melting galciers. Rock fragments are angular/sub angular
-    Moraines are Glacially formed **accumulation of unconsolidated glacial debris (regolith and rock)**  
![[Landforms-image6-00085771.jpg]]
-   Outwash deposits are glacio fluvial deposits are stratified and assorted
- Moraines  
	- long ridges of deposits of glacial tills
	-   Types of Moraines :
		-   Lateral moraines : parallel to valleys they join to from horse shoe shaped ridge.
		-   Ground Moraine : formed by retreating glacier leave irregular sheet of till
		-   Medial Moraine in the centre.
	-   Hanging Valleys are  tributary valleys that hang above the main valley, commonly seen in U Shaped valleys.
-    Winding ridge of ***un-assorted depositions*** of rock, gravel, clay etc. running along a glacier ***in a till plain*** are called Eskers 
![[Landforms-image8-00085771.jpeg|300x300]]
-   Drumlin : 
	-   Inverted boat-shaped deposition in a till plain caused by deposition 
	-   has a stoss end and a tail
	-   composed of gravel, sand
