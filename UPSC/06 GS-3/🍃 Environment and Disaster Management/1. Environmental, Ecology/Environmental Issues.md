- Cost of Env degradation is about 6% of IN GDP or Rs 3.75 trillion

## Pollution in IHR
- expansion, trekking, tourism etc has caused continued waste dumping
- unplanned growth, non compliance w/ prescribed norms and guidelines

### Various initiatives taken to clean IHR region :

-   HP banned plastic brought laws for disposal of non-biodegradable **garbage**, increased minimum **thickness** of plastic etc
-   Nainital Lake has adopted the ==Mission Butterfly program for scientific garbage disposal==. 
-   ==Lake and Waterways Dev Authority LAWDA== has taken initiative to control pollution **in Dal Lake**
-   Assam Hill Land and Ecological Sites #Act, 2006 taken up ==to prevent indiscrminate cutting of hills and filling of water bodies==.

### Recomendations to combat pollution
- guidelines to prohibit indiscriminate disposal of garbage
- treatment segregation at point of source, document waste composition
- 4R principle, innovation in treatment, garbage management
- prevent fragmentation of habitat in hill areas, designate areas for dev
- enforce architechtural norms, prevent deforestation, integrated development
- Community based ecotourism as sustainable alternative to commercial tourism ex Himalayan Homestays, Sikkim's Ultimate Tourist Destination policy

## Sand Mining
- process of removal of sand and grave

### Impact of Sand Mining
- causes stripping of sand natural carpet that causes downstream erosion
- prevents sand from acting as aquifers
- revenue loss to exchequer, forces river to change its course 
- adversely impacts habitat of micro-organism
- damagest coastal ecosystem

### Suggestions to Combat
- use manufactured sand as alternative : produced from stones used for aggregates
- use fly ash from industries as alternative of sand.
- periodic assessment  of sand bed, prudence to lease out mining
- make sand mining to be carried out only by labour

## Palm Oil - Environmental Issues and India's role in it #important #PrelimsPYQ 
- ==33% of vegetable oil made from it==, consumers are India, Indonesia and China
- used for cooking food as a substitute of butter, alo in cosmetics, soaps and detergents as base material

### Environmental Impacts 
- to meet production deforestation carried out in countries like Indonesia, Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Sumatra, Congo Basin
- Loss of biodiversity particularly Orangutans
- Climate Change due to deforestation 
- use of pesticides and fertilizers esp Paraquat a type of herbicide
- Indian imports from Malaysia, Indonesia. 
- AP is the higher producer in IN

### Major constraints in domestic cultivation
- Geographical location not ideal ==best is 8Â° N and S of Equator==
- Irrigation requires regular rainfall, Long gestation period of 4 yr
- small farm holdings, limited investment by corporate sector

### Gov plans 
- Mo Food give subsidies for distribution of palm oil under PDS
- Oil Palm Dev program now part of Integrated #Scheme of Oilseeds
- Roundtable on Sustainable Oil RSPO estd in 2004 provides certification #body 

## Colony Collapse disorder CCD : 
- population of Bees plummeting due to unexplained reason
- Causes could be : 
	- Global Warming, parasitic infection, malnutrition, metal pollution, stress, habitat loss
	- ==Neonicotinides are nictoine like insecticides== : water soluble absorbed by pollinators from pollen and nector of treated palnts may be leading to dec
- policy decision to protect bees, reward farmers to protect bees, strengthen bee research, Integrated pest management

## Wildlife Deaths due to collitions w/ trains
- Art 51A, 48A
- Coordination b/w MoEFCC and Mo Railways
- demarcate vulnerable patches with signboards,
- Electronic tagging of elephants, leopards etc
- improve infra, posting forest officials in Railway control rooms for better coordination

## Impact of Radiation from towers
- EMW generated heats up small birds due to low weight and higher surface area, lower body fluid, disturb their ability to navigate, collision leads to deaths
- In humans it causes psychological changes, genetic defects, fatigue, nausea, irritability, headaches

### Responsibilities of stakeholders
- MoEFCC should notify impact to concerned agencies
- Regular monitoring by state and local bodies, carry out EIA before giving permission
- State Env and Forest dept take awareness measures
- DoT should avoid overlapping of radiation fields, location of towers be geotagged and be made public, refine standards on safe limit of exposure to EMR, precaution to minimise exposure

## Genetically Engineered Trees
- ==1st GE tree in Belgium 1988==, China has inculcated in large scale
- act as carbon sinks ==to help meet Clean Dev Mechanism under Kyoto protocol==
- Difficult to decipher behaviour of new gene in natural env; likely to contaminate vast expanse of native forest threaten ecological balance
- In Indian Rubber research institute dev 1st GET 

## Steps taken to combat Air Pollution 
- improved fuel, comprehensive policy for abetement of pollution
- tightening industrial emission norms, mandatory env clearance for specific industries
- air quality monitoring improved, assessment of pollution load, public awareness
