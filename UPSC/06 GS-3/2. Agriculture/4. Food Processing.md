- Food Systems Summit by UN org by 3 agencies FAO, International Fund for Agri Dev, WFP
	- convened to achieve SDGs.
	- Food system involves producing, processing, transporting and consuming food.
- Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Unnat Krishi Shiksha Yojana #scheme PDDUUSKY : 
	- dev human resource in organic farming, natural farming and cow based economy implemented by ICAR.
- Issues w/ mandatory Food Fortification : 
	- inconclusive studies supporting FF mostly supported by companies. 
	- Could harm informal economy of the farmers, processors ex rice/oil mills.
	- Inc nutrients chemically could affect absorption
	- Instead diet diversification and higher protein consumption is needed.
- Benefits of food fortification : 
	- safe method of improving nutrition among people
	- No need to change food habits -> socio-culturally acceptable
	- does not alter characteristics of food, can be implemented quickly
	- Cost effective
- **National Mission on Edible Oil Oil palm NMEO-OP** : achieve self reliance, emphasis on NE states and Andaman Nicobar. Fin assistance based on a viability formula. IN largest consumer of Palm oil. #scheme

- It refers to various techniques and operations by which raw foodstuffs are transformed into food that are suitable for consumptions, cooking or storage.
- FPI have strong base in India due to abundant production of food articles, aromatic and medicinal plants. 
- Constitutes about 8.83% GVA in Manufacturing and 10.66% GVA in Agriculture sector.
	- Indias share in export of processed food globally is 2.31%.
	
**Challenges with Food Processing** in India and the world :
	- Lower urban population of India and does not have urban food habits.
	- recently there has been enough awareness regarding harmful chemical used in the country
	- A move to vegan culture has decreased processed food market

**Importance of Food processing**
	- FP aims to make food more digestible, nutritious and extend the shelf life.
	- Covers all the aspect that food items go through farm to the consumers plate ex cleaning, grading and packaging.
	- Can create sustainable livelihoods and economic development for rural communities.
	- Farmers, Consumers and Economy all 3 benefit from it.
	- It increases opportunities in allied sectors such as supply chain management, cold storage, financing etc.

**Rules and Regulation**
	- most FP enterprises do not require licenses except alcoholic drinks.
	- 100% FDI through automatic route.
	- Automatic FDI for reserved items to be manufactured by MSE's upto 24%/

 
-   FP is transforming raw ingredients into food long shelf life, conc mostly in coastal areas
-   2 processes In FPI Raw material - Food (Primary)and Value addition (Jams Squashes)
-   Importance - link b/w agri and industries, absorbs major share of workers from agri, prevents wastage, processed food requires less space/storage, can be exported
-   Adv - Resource advantage, increasing employment, curbing migration, curb food inflation, crop diversification, demand potential, driver of growth
-   **Upstream stage** - involves searching and extracting RM
    -   Requirements - Accessibility to RM, Modern extraction, good linkages w/ farmers, Storage facilities , quality testing facilities, transport facilities, work force
-   **Downstream** - processing of materials collected
    -   Requirements - latest processing techniques, processing machinery, quality testing facility, Org retail stores, Work force
-   Supply Chain Mgt ![Supply Chain Management](Static---Food-Processing-and-R-image1-23324378.jpg)
**Challenges :** 
	- are small, lack good R&D, 
	- lack of skilled workforce, 
	- lack of right vision and support from Gov, 
	- lack of good transportation, 
	- lack of organised retail, 
	- limitation in supply chain, 
	- limitation in quality, lack of modern regulation

Various govt institutions that have been established are
	- Indian Institute of Crop processing Technology IICPT
	- National Meat and Poultry Processing Board NMPPB
	- Indian Grape Processing Board
	- National Institute of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management
