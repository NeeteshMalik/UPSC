## Soil Formation
- Result of Decay and Medium of Growth is mixture of rock debris and organic materials
- Soil Science aka Pedology, soil formation/ Pedogenesis
- 3 layers are
	- Horizon A : topmost zone, where organic material is incorporated w/ mineral matter, nutrients and water
	- Horizon B : transition b/w A and C, very less organic matter
	- Horizon C : composed of loose parent material

### The soil forming factors are :
-   Parent material : ex size fo debris, structure, mineral and chemical composition.
-   Topography 
	- diff topographic features would have diff exposures to sunlight, drainage etc.
	- Soils will be thin on steep slopes, thick over flat uplands.
-   Climate  
	- Moisture - Low moisture/humidity leads to salt accumulation in soils -> aridity.    
	- Temp - affects chemical and biological activity
-   Biological activity ex action of nitrogen fixing bacteria, humus accumulation.
-   Time

## Classification of Soils

### Alluvial soils :
-   40% of total area of country, depositional; nature varies from sandy loam to clay.
-   Are rich in **potash** but poor in **phosphorous**.
-   Colour varies from light grey to ash grey.
-   Khadar is new alluvium and Bhangar is older both contain calerous conc of Kankars.

### Black Soil :
-   aka as **Regur Soil** or **Black Cotton soil**.
-   Are clayey, deep and impermeable.
-   Develop deep cracks and swell when water is added called self-ploughing.
-   Absorption and loss of moisture is slow but retains moisture for very long.
-   rich in lime, iron, magnesia and alumina.
-   also contain potash but lack ==Phosphorous, N2 and organic matter==.

### Red and Yellow soil :
-   Develops on crystalline **igneous rocks** in areas of low rainfall.
-   becomes yellow when **hydrated**.
-   Are poor in Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Humus.
-   fine grained yellow soil is fertile but coarser ones are not.

### Laterite soil :
-   Develops in areas with high **temp** and **rainfall**.
-   Due to intense leaching Lime and silica are leached.
-   poor in organic matter, Nitrogen, Phosphate and calcium.
-   Iron oxide and Potash are in excess.
-   crops like Cashewnut etc is grown, not suitable for cultivation.
-   used to make bricks, found in higher areas of Peninsular plateau.

### Arid soils
-   Vary from **Red** to **Brown** in colour, are sandy and saline.
-   Lack Moisture and humus, Nitrogen.
-   Kanker layer is common here.

### Saline soils :
-   also known as **Usara** soils.
-   large proportion of **Na**, **K** and **Mg**.
-   waterlogged and swampy areas and arid/semi-arid regions.
-   Due to capillary action salt gets deposited on the top layer of fertile soils making them saline. To avoid this Gypsum is added.

### Peaty Soil :

-   Found in areas of heavy **rainfall** and high **humidity**.
-   has high humus and organic content upto 40-50%.
-   Normally heavy and black in colour.
-   Sometimes be alkaline.

### Forest soils :
-   **loamy** and **silty** on valley sides and coarse grained in upper slopes.
-   In snow bound areas they are acidic with low humus content.
-   Lower levels they are fertile.

Soil Degradation : decline in soil fertility due to erosion and misuse, degree varies from topography, wind velocity and amount of rainfall.

Soil Erosion : destruction of soil cover when far exceeds soil formation, water and air are the most powerful agents.

## Soil Conservation
- Check open cultivation on slopes.
- Slopes of gradient 15-25% not be used for cultivation.
- Check overgrazing and shifting cultivation.
- Contour bunding, Countour terracing, regulated forestry, controlled grazing, cover cropping, mixed farming, crop rotation.
- Prevent gully erosion through check dams.
- Uncultivable lands be converted into pastures for grazing.
- Stabilize sand dunes in arid areas.
- Central Soil Conservation zone set up for this.
