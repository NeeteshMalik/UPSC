-   **El Nino** can be used to predict air pollution level in north IN; prevent airborne pollutants to move out of densely pop areas, whereas **Antarctic Oscillation (AAO)** occasion create strong wind condition and have uneven impact.

-   Impact based crater in Moon named after Indian physicist **Sisir Kumar Mitra** by the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN), largest crater on the Moon is called **South Pole-Aitkin Basin**;
-   **ANDREX (Antarctic Deep Water Rates of Export) Project** to assess the role of [Weddell Gyre](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weddell_Gyre) how oceans absorbs CO2; Southern Ocean/ Antarctic ocean plays a key role in influencing climatic change
-   **Mid-Monsoon lightening project** : 1st ever mapping of lightning strikes across country. It is possible to predict strikes 30-40mins ahead. **Odisha** recorded the highest number of lightening, most deaths occurred in UP.
-   **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation(AMOC)** :  large sys of oceanic current that carries ==warm water from the Tropic to North Atlantic helps in distributing heat and energy== is weakening and warming up IN ocean.
-   Way ahead to check floods : improve drainage, see whole city as catchment areas, executive and ecological body, risk mapping, monitor town planning, protect GW recharge
-   **Space Hurricanes** : above north pole on ionosphere, caused when ==Solar wind and Earth's magnetic field interact==, spun counter clockwise, produce auroras and made up of plasma and ionised gases. Interferes w/ sats and radio signals 
- [[Heat Wave and Cold Wave#Heat Wave |Heat Wave]]
-  Monsoon 2021 : 103% of LPA, Low possiblity of El Nino. 2019 and 2020 both were above avg. 
- **Leonids Meteor shower** occurs every 33 years. Metor shower happens when Earth passes through the trail or debris left by comets or asteroids.

Physical geography consists of 
1. Climatology
	- [[Climate of the World]] 
1. Geomorphology
	- [[Earth]]
	- [[Oceans]]
	- [[Rocks]]
	- [[Landforms]]
	- [[Coastal Landforms]]
2. Biogeography
	-  - study of distribution of species and ecosystem in geographic space and geological time.
	 - this distri depends on latitude, elevation isolation and habitat area.
	 - Further divided into phytogeography and Zoogeography
3. Soil Geography
	- [[Soils]]
