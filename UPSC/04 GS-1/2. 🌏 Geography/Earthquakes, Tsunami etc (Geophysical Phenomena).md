- [Daylight saving time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRQcW9ODoP4) : Setting up of clock ahead or backwards to extend the daylight hours. This was done since it saves energy, completion of work earlier. But it has issues with increasing heart problems, spike in workplace injuries, on Agriculture and labour and productivity.
- Frequency of very severe storms in Arabian Sea has increased due to inc is global temp/warming. Wind shear is driving cyclones from far areas towards Western Coast.
- Pacific Ring of Fire was formed due ot subduction of oceanic tectonic plates beneath lighter contiental plates.

- [[Heat Wave and Cold Wave#Cold Waves |Cold Wave]]
- **Bomb Cyclone** aka **Bombogenesis** or **Nor'easter** is a mid latitude cyclone that intensifies rapidly. It occurs when atmospheric pressure at the centre of the cyclone drops at least 24 milibars over 24 hrs. 
	- Cold airs and fronts are an essential feature for bomb cyclones and are associated with blizzards.
	- It occurs in areas of northwest Atlantic, NW Pacific and sometimes the mediterranean sea from late winter to early spring. 
- Geomagnetic storms are caused due to solar flares when they interact with Earths magnetic field. Solar coronal mass ejection CME or Co-rotating interaction region CIR are constituents of the storm. 
	- G1 storms affects power grids causing weak fluctuations, minor impacts on satellite operation and northern and southern lights occur. 
	- G5 storm causes voltage problems, blackouts, radios are hindered.
- **Marine heatwaves** are a coherent area of extreme warm sea surface temp that happen when sea temperatures are warmer than normal for extended period of time. 
	- Ocean current cause this, weak winds does not remove heated water from ocean surface to move. 
	- Western Indian ocean has seen largest inc in these waves.

-   **Pacific Decadal Oscillation(PDO)** : oceanic current located in pacific ocean duration is longer than ENSO (20-30 yrs), major effect in Alaskan weather and global temp, ==North East India rapidly drying due to it==.
-   **Anthropocene** : new epoch in Earth's geological history has been proposed present geological time interval describe humanity's impact on env. 
-   Mt Sinabung Indonesia erupts, INDO has 127/400 active volcanos.
-   **Summer Solstice**(stand still) occurs on June 21 caused by Earths tilt along axis on this day the
-   Ozone hole is the smallest ever recorded this year since 1982. This was due to ==warm stratospheric temperatures== not because of dramatic recovery.
-   Due to climate change : increased temp El Nino events are likely to become more frequent; the onset location has shifted from the eastern pacific to the western pacific causing frequent and extreme [El Nino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o) events
-   NE monsoon is a permanent feature occurs from October to December rains in TN, KTAKA, TEL, AP, KER is seen ^c72265
	- La Nina has a negative impact on it but a +ve on SE Monsoon.
- **Seismic noise** : caused by persistent vibrations of ground ex earthquakes, volcanic eruptions etc.
-   **Polar vortex** : low pressure whirling cone region in the stratospheric levels around the poles, strongest in winter Has caused closing of ozone layer
-   ==Churchandpur Mao Fault and Mat fault== in Mizoram
-   CO2 in thermal springs are sourced from ==metamorphic decarbonation of rocks==. **Geothermal springs** are major source of CO2 emission
-   **La Nina** this year has led to Northeast monsoon being subdued ^a98c6b
-   **Subdued cyclones**  occur due to calm South China sea, weak La Nina. **Madden Julian Oscillation** has a -ve influence over cyclones, vertical wind shear ^59356a
-   Hurricanes are measured by the **Saffir Simpson wind** scale
-   Upwelling caused by a previous storm ==decreases the intensity== of the next one
-   **Solar flares** could cause the visibility of Northern lights in areas of lower latitude. **Aurora** caused by collision of fast moving electron w/ oxygen/nitrogen molecule of Earth's upper atm.
-   Not all droughts caused by EL Nino, North Atlantic atmospheric disturbances also resp. **Rossby waves** that are waves of air current when hit Tibetan plateau suppress rainfall.
-   ==Geminid meteor shower== occurs form an asteroid or extinct comet not in a comet
- Axis of earth drifting more than usual due to ==melting glaciers==. North pole drifting Eastwards.
- **Lineament** : linear feature dictated by an underlying geological structure ex faults.
- Most Planets rotate **west to east** but Venus and Uranus rotate from east to west
- **Halo** around sun appears when white light passes through ice crystals.
- **Supermoon** occurs when full moon coincides with Moon's closest approach/ Perigree. 
- Heat Dome : traps hot air rising above. Cold air coming from poles and jet streams act as a dome which pushes the rising hot air below causing high temp.
- **Auroras** : formed when charged particles from solar winds comes in contact w/ gasses in atmosphere. Called Aurora Borealis/ Northern Lights in North Hemisphere and Aurora Australis in South. Martian Auroras are discrete/ disjointed since its magnetic field is unevenly distributed.
-  Separation of charges in clouds where +ve charge moves upwards taken by lighter snow and -ve comes down brought by heavier hail. These -ve charges start to move downwards called stepped leader comes in contact w/ moving up +ve charge causes lightning.
-  **Earth Overshoot Day** by Global Footprint Network : day when on which we have used all biological resources of earth which it can renew in a year. Day is coming early every year. We consume 1.7 earths/yr.
-  52% inc in frequency of cyclones in Arabian Sea and 8% in BoB since 2000. Reasons : 1. Inc in surface temp -> more intensification of cyclonse due to inc convection. 2. Underlying features ex land sea boundary, bays, estuaries. 
-  Hurricanes are classified under the Saffir Simpson Hurricane wind scale.
-  Effect of climate change on El Nino
	1.  Inc CO2 will weaken future ENSO and surface temp variability.
	1.  Will lose heat to atm more quickly
	1.  Reduce temp difference b/w Easter and western tropical pacific -> inhibit dev of ENSO
	2.  Tropical Instability waves will weaken and disrupt La Nina event.

## Cyclone

### Why Bay of Bengal is Hotbed of Cyclones
- vastness ideal condition to create low pressure area
- shaped like a trough
- high sea surface temp
- more rainfall and warm air currents keep temp high
- constant inflow of fresh warm water
- lack of landmass
- absence of air movements

**Why not Arabian sea ?**
- strong winds do not allow build up of low pressure area
- lack of fresh water inflow helps keep temp low

### Fani in Odisha
-   Advance release of funds from SDRF (State Disaster Response Fund) to State gov AP, Odisha, TN + WB, estd under the Disaster Management Act 2005 recomm of the 13th Fin Commission, Central Gov contributes 75% to 90% fund ambit MoHA audited by CAG, additional funding is given through National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).
-   Seismic impact of human activities far reaching not localised eg fluid injection for petroleum extraction - instability in faults b/w rocks - trigger earthquakes, study lead to reliable models to mitigate earthquake hazard

### Naming of Cyclones
- WMO/UNESCAP assigns names for cyclones in BoB and Arabian Sea
- 8 member countires around this area give names
- Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre RSMC, New Delhi is responsible for naming these storms

### Recent Cyclones 
- Hurricane Hanna in Texas
- Typhoon Goni - Phillipines
- Cyclone Nivar hit Puducherry
- Amphan in West Bengal
- Tauktae cyclone in Lakshadweep
- Yaas in Odisha
