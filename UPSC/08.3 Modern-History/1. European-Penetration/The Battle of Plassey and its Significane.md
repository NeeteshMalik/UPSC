- Not militarily important
- Diplomacy of Clive to seed treachery into the camp of Nawab is what excelled

```ad-Views

**K.M. Pannikar** : Plassey was a transaction that the rich bankers of Bengal and Mir Jafar sold to the English

**PE Roberts** : By 1760 British were supreme in Bengal, Military and political power of French and Dutch was gone. British influence extended from Bengal, Bihar to southern boundary of Oudh.

**NK Sinha** : Conspirators depended upon the aid of a foreign power which was not the case at Battle of Giria this proved to be their undoing. 
```
- Solidified the position that British yoke cannot be put off of Bengal
- Nawab was now dependent on BR troops for his rule
- Gradual percolation of power to the hands of the English -> Mir Jafar conspiring with the Dutc![[Bengal - Mir Jafar and Mir Kasim#Vansittart treaty]]
- the Dutch were defeated at Bedara
