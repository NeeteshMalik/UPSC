- Times of London Called it rotten throughout and Bombay Times wrote He disgraces the name of Englishmen. 
- Robert Peel the PM of england described it as unjust which would discredit the name and character of British authorities.
- Napier Himself said that it was a humane piece of rascality it will be.
- **Gladstone** : Mischief of retaining Sindh was less that mischief of abandoning Sindh.
- **Percival Spear** : annexation was least creditable and fascist but it was in their own best interest to integrate them to the world 

```

### Annexation of Sindh as a sequel to Afghan War
- Napier believed it to be the tail of Afghan storm
- PE Roberts has called it morally and politically a sequel of Afghan war
- Annex done for strategic puroposed to build defence against Russo-Persian designs -> this was validated in a letter that was written by Lord Auckland to British resident in Sind
- Amirs were coerced to provide finances, bases etc for Afghan War. Various treaties were forced on them to meet the changing situation on it.
- Failure in the war gave reason to fortify frontiers and British prestige due to the loss has suffered greatly. Thus to demonstrate England's strength and re-establish her prestige steps were taken
> Elphinstone equated Britain to a bully who was knocked at the street and went back home to beat his wife in revenge.
