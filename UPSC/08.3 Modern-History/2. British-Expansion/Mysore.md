```ad-Views

**Mohbihul Hasan** : Regarding Tipu as first Indian nationalist and martyr is wrong. There was no sense of nationalism or awareness among subjects. He fought wars to preserve his own power and independence.

**Ashok Sen** :  TS had little success in setting forth a course of change(economic or political) significantly different from the general experience of 18th century IN politica snd Society.

**Alfred Lyall** : TS had no political ability of higher sorts or instinct of a storng and able ruler. He was swept away by a flood that was overwheliming far greater states that Mysore.
