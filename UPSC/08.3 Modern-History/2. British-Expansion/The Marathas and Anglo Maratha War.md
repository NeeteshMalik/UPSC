## Disintegration of Maratha's reasons :
- [x] #todo 
1. **Inept Leadership** : M were despotic dependent on personality and character of head of state. No settled constitution. BR II was criminal in character, BR I himself went to sign Treaty of Bassein accepting subsidiary alliance. Daulat Rao Sindhia was not worthy successor to Mahadji Sindhia. 
 > **Sardesai** : Their misdeeds brought Poona court and society to moral degradation that no ones life, property or honour was safe. 
1. **Inherent defects of Maratha State** : 
> **Jadunath Sarkar** : at no time did they make any concerted attempt at well thought out organised communal improvement, spread of education or unification of people. Their cohesion was not organic but artificial.
1. **Absence of stable economic policy** : After war w/ Aurangzeb M peasants took up arms. State mostly depended on plunder for revenue viz Chauth and Sardeshmukhi. Civil war among leaders and Famine in 1804 took heavy toll on life. Leaders had to mortgage territories to bankers. There was no foreig trade or industry War became their National Industry
2. **Weakness of Political Set-up** : Was a loose confederation. First the Peshwa usurped the power of Chattrapati then Subordinate War Lords did the same w/ Peshwa. They set up semi independent kingdom. Irreconciliable hostility b/w them viz Sindhias and Bhosles was detrimental. Mutual Jealousies among them was common.
3. **Inferior Military System** :  In Organisation, war weapons, discipline, effective leadership. Centrifugal tendencies -> frequent treacheries. Motives of M soldiers were no higher than personal interest. Neglect of Cavalry affected mobility.  
 > **Alfred Lyall** : abandonment of Guerilla warfare was cardinal mistake
4. **Superior English Diplomacy** : Before wars EIC wanted to win allies and isolate enemies diplomatically. Ex in 2nd Anglo Maratha war English won over Gaekwad, Peshwa and other Maratha Jagirdars. 
5. **Superior English Espionage** :  
 > **Sardesai** : Marathas knew very little about the England, their govt, factories, character, arms and armaments.
6. **Progressive Outlook of the English** : Indian still wedded to old dogmas and notions. Very little care given for scientific inventions, oceanic voyages or acquisition of colonies. Marathas cared more about religious merit ang distribution of gifts to Brahmins. Entire IN outlook was medieval
```ad-Views
**JN Sarkar** : Growth of orthodoxy and Brahmin Maratha diff sapped vitality of the state. <br> 
**GW Forrest** : Jealousy from various causes b/w M chiefts and Brahmins would prevent union of whole empire
