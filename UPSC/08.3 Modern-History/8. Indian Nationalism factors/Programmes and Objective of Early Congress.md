## Objective of Early Nationalists
 - Basic objectives of the early nationalist leaders were to lay the foundations of a secular and democratic national movement, 
 - to politicize and politically educate the people, 
 - to form the headquarters of the movement, that is, to form an all-India leadership group, 
 - and to develop and propagate an anti-colonial nationalist ideology.

###  Certain drawbacks of early Nationalists
-   Failed to understand the character of the colonial state
-   Did not carry out anti-imperialist mass struggles.
 

## Objectives of Early Congress
-   The promotion of national unity was a major objective of the Congress.
	-   If an overwhelming majority of Hindu or Muslims objected no resolution was to be passed - 1888
	-   wherever Parsis, Christians, Muslims or Hindus were a minority their number in elected council cannot be less than the proportion in population - 1889
-   The second major objective of the early Congress was to create a common political platform around which people could gather and conduct their political activities.
	-   This is why Congress was not to take up social reform.
	-   All initial activity of the early nationalism was geared towards the consolidation of public opinion.
	-   The primary objective was to go beyond the redressal of immediate grievances and organize sustained political activity along the lines of the Anti-Corn Law League.
	-   create a common all-India national-political leadership
-   WC Bonnerji reiterated that one of the Congress objective was the eradication of race, creed or provincial prejudices amongst all lovers of our country and promotion of intimacy and friendship.
-   **internalization and indigenization of political democracy** based on the doctrine of the sovereignty of people.
-   It was organised in the form of a Parliament and rooted **parliamentary democrac**y in India.
-   made **maintenance of civil liberties and their extension** an integral part of the national movement.
