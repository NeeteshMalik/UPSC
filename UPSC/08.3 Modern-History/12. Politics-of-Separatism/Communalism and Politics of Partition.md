##   Communal ideology 
- believes that people who follow same religion have common interests,
- their interests are divergent from the interest of the followers of other religion  
- in the third stage the interests of each other are seen different and incompatible

###   Liberal communalists 
- believed that the difference of opinion could be accommodated and brought together. 
- Most communalists ==before 1937== had such views viz Hindu Mahasabha, Muslim League etc.

## How Communalism Developed

-   Communalism is a ==consequence of emergence of modern politics of mass politicisation and mobilisation and an off set of colonialism==.
-   Some middle classes benefited from communalism especially in govt employment giving it a fillip. They often fluctuated b/w anti-imperialism and communalism based politics.
-   class interest of various landlords in places such as Punjab, Malabar etc were often used to stir up communal dissensions garbing such differences as imcompatible religious distinctions.
-   Communal colours in agrarian revolts were a feature in the 20th century. It was absent in such prior struggles
-   The British policy of divide and rule was used to counter nationalist forces.

###   Various ways used to encourage communalism was 
-   Treating Hindus, Muslims etc as separate entities having different interests.
-   Official favour and patronage to communalists.
-   Communal press were tolerated and nationalist press gagged.
-   Communal demands were accepted which strengthened such organisations.
-   Communal leaders were seen as the representatives of the minorities.
-   Hindu extremist leaders brought various religious symbols for mass mobilisation of people. Viz Shivaji and Ganpati festivals of Tilak. Muslims were portrayed as foreigners in various plays, novels etc.
-   This Hindu tinge was the not a cause but a failure of nationalists to check communalism
-   Communal, unscientific and distorted view of Indian history contributed to it.

## Before 1937

###  Syed Ahmed Khan
> -   was a liberal communalist. 
> - In his early years he was against communalism and even received funds from Hindus for the formation of his educational institutes.
> -   But after the formation of Congress when its anti-imperialist ideology became clear. He became a loyalist, main reason for this was that Muslims who were in minority and backwards would lose gov jobs, seats in educational institutions etc.
> -   He however wanted Muslims to be politically neutral as Politicisation of Indians was frowned upon by the Gov.
> -   In his later speeches he emphasised difference of interest of Hindus and Muslims.


-   Muslim nationalists who participated with Congress like in the Swadeshi movement was seen as anti-Islamists.
-   This however did not stop the spread of nationalist ideas among the Muslims.
-   Muslim league was formed by Agha Khan and Salimullah in Dhaka. Their ==initial aim was to prevent Muslims from joining the nationalist ranks==.

###   The Hindu communalist 
> - led by Zamindars, Landlords etc accepted the communal representation of History.
> - they declared that Hindi was language of Hindus and Urdu of Muslims.  
> - undertook anti-cow slaughter movements.
> -   Various such institutions that were formed were the **Punjab Hindu Sabha** by Lal Chand in 1904. **All India Hindu Mahasabha** in 1915.
> -   But Hindu communalist institutions were sickly compared to Muslimsleague because of its support from the reactionary elements in Zamindars, Beauraucrats etc <- difference b/w Hindu and Muslim Communalists

### Lucknow Pact December 1916
> -   Muslim League and Congress jointly put forward :
> -   Common political demands including the demand of self-government of India
> -   It accepted separate electorates and reservation of seats
> -   The pact was a tacit acceptance of communalism.

-   After the NCM was called back movements such as ==Sangathan and Shuddi for Hindus and Tanzeem and Tablighi for Muslims== started for communal consolidation and religious conversion.
-   The ==responsivists among Swarajists== wanted to cooperate with the gov for safeguarding Hindu interests. They carried out movts against secular congresspersons. #important 
-   Nationalist leaders tried to make efforts to oppose communalism but were not able to remove it because they often based their measure on compromise.
- Pact was led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak from INC and Jinnah from AIML. 
- It marked the reunion of moderate and radical wings of the congress. 
- Most of the demands that was put by it was accepted by it in the GOI Act 1919.

###   Simon Commission 
> - challenged Indian leaders to come out a solution to the constitutional question.
> -   The Muslim communal leaders came out with the Delhi Proposal
> -   Congress came out with the Nehru Report
> -   Distraught with the Nehru Report, ==Jinnah came out with his Fourteen Points which became the basis of all communal propaganda in the future==.

-   By negotiating with the communal leaders ==congress legitimized their politics==. It also weakened their stance to carry out a hard political and ideological campaign against communalism.
-   The communal force joined hands with the reactionary element of the British ruling classes during the Round Table Conferences RTC.

## After 1937
-   communalism started assuming a ==virulent, extremist and Fascist form== based on the politics of hatred, fear, psychosis and irrationality.
-   Acquired a popular base and began to mobilise popular mass opinion.
-   The ==youth during this phase was turning towards the left== thus as a response the Hindu - Muslim landlords, money lenders, jagirdars etc to save their interest turned towards Communalism.
-   WW II strengthened the reliance on the communal card. Muslim League was recognised as the sole spokesperson for Muslims and given veto to any political settlement.
-   interest of other Hindu and Sikh communalist were side lined.
-   1937 elections the ML and Hindu Mahasabha fared poorly and made them realise that they need to cater a more militant mass based politics.

### MA Jinnah
> -   Jinnah was a nationalist when he joined the Congress. 
> - He bitterly opposed the formation of Muslim League in 1906 and called it as 'dividing the nation against itself'.
> -   He joined the League in 1913 after that his views took a communal term and he became a communal nationalist. 
> - He got the congress to accept demands of Separate electorates and communal reservations.
> -   left INC along with other liberal leaders in 1920 disagreeing with Gandhi's mass based politics. 
> - He was ==not willing to go into political oblivion so he turned towards Communal Politics==. This was his liberal communalist phase.
> -   After 1937 his speeches became of hatred and venomous. 
> - He ==called for the extermination of Hindus and INC as Fascists==. Emphasising Islam was in danger of extinction if Congress were to rule.
> -   Nationalist Muslims like Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad were termed as show boys of the congress and maligned in speeches.

### Hindu Communalists
-   Lala Lajpat Rai and MM Malviya were the 2 main liberal communal leaders.
-   MS Gowalkar and VD Savarkar of the RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha were Hindu communalists. They wanted the Muslims to live as subordinates in a Hindu nation without privileges and civil rights.

#### Veer Damodar Savarkar
- founded Mitra Mela in 1899, 'Abhinav Bharat Society' in Pune & 'Free IN society' in London. 
	- He founded the 'Free India Society' to celebrate important Indian dates in the calender viz festivals etc.
- mem of Tilaks 'Swaraj Party' wrote **'Indian war of Independence 1857**' was banned; 
- became Prez of Hindu Mahasabha cooperated w/ M.League to form gov in Sindh, Bengal and NWFP
- was against foreign goods and participated in 1905 Swadeshi Movement
- was an atheist, disapproved orthodox Hindu belief ex cow worship 
- worked for abolishing untouchability
- President of Hindu Mahasabha 1937-1943
- founded the 2 nation theory in his book Hindutva

### Could Jinnah have been reconciled?
-   Two major Controversies around the communal problem Jinnah could have been conciliated and a coalition could have been formed during 1937.
    -   Jinnah was already a full-fledged communalist by then
    -   Congress tried all possible efforts to negotiate with him
    -   Jinnah wanted the Congress to accept that it was Hindu body, which was unacceptable to congress
    -   Coalition was not possible for the left had threatened to launch a mass campaign if it was done so.

### Failure of INC to contain Communalism
-   The congress relied too heavily on negotiations with the communal leaders and failed to evolve a viable long term strategy to combat it.
-   Communal riots due to K movt erupted in Malabar
- J Nehru + other leaders emphasised secularist view of IN


```ad-Views

**Christophe Jaffrelot** : M ==mobilisation under K movt generated sense of inferiority and insecurity among H== who started counter mobilisation
  
**Gyanendra Pandey** : 1920s saw shift in ==Congress's conceptualisation of nationalism, religion relegated to private sphere==

**Ayesha Jalal** : M needed political arrangement capable of accommodating cultural diff. ML till 1937 was little more than a debating forum
