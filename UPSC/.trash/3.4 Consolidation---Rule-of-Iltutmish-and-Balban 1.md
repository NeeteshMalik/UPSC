### Problems faced by Balban during his rule
-   https://www.historyforexam.com/2018/12/problems-faced-by-balban.html
-   Internal dissensions from Nobles - more serious threat, attempt by Rajputs, Rajas, Big Zamindars to expel them ex from Gwalior, Ranthambore
-   Lakhnauti rulers tried to assert their independence ex Yuzbek, Thughril were appt by Balban
-   Mongol Threat - Rulers of Ghuz, Ghazni ousted by M captured cis Indus region

### Assessment of Balban
-   Stern enforcement of law - basis for growth, future expansion of Sultanat
-   Revenues previously appropriated by Chihalgani now went to Gov
-   No large scale building activity, emphasis more on army
-   Kept Mongols at bay, but not able to push them beyond Lahore
-   Failed to control Tughril's rebellion
-   Resorted to policy of poison, secret assassination of nobles to break Chihalghani's power; Exaggeration of family, ancestry. Both proved counter productive
-   Built a polity not capable of sustaining itself, but had capacity of expansion
