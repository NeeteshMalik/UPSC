-   Silviculture is art of cultivating forest trees, Olericulture is of vegetables, Viticulture of grapes, Arboriculture is of individual trees, shrubs, etc. Pomology is of fruit,
-   17.2 % contribution to agriculture, 57% workforce,

-   Kharif - Monsoon Crop from June to Oct/Nov - warm wet weather ex Cotton, Rice, Jowar, Bajara
-   Rabi from Oct to March - longer length of day ex Wheat, gram, sunflower
-   Zaid is Summer Crop - warm dry weather, longer weather Ex groundnuts, Watermelon, Pumpkins, Gourds
-   Cereals are cultivated grasses, Millets are types of Cereal grown in less important area where productivity and economics is less
-   Pulses are cultivated to enrich the soil and utilise the residual moisture
-   Forage crops are where entire vegetative part is used as green fodder
-   Jowar, Bajra, Mung are Rain fed crops. Chilli, sugarcane, Banana, Papaya etc are irrigated crops
-   Photoperiod is the sunlight time required for plants to flower
-   Ratoon cropping - raising a crop with regrowth coming out of roots or stocks of harvested crops. Ex Sugarcane, Banana, Sorghum, Pineapple.
-   Examples of intercropping Maize + Cowpea , Sorghum/Groundnut + Redgram, Potato/Wheat + Mustard.
-   In *mixed cropping* seeds are grown without row arrangement, drylands, seeds are mixed together and then sown, done for subsistence purposes.
-   Garden land farming is supplemental irrigation by lifting water from underground sources
-   Dryland - entirely dependent on rainfall
-   *Mixed farming* - farming with crop production, raising livestock, poultry, fishing, bee keeping.
-   Specialised farming - 50% of income of total crop production comes from single crop, where no crop gives 50% total income called general/Diversified farming
-   Crop Rotation - Leguminous crop fixes N in soil should be grown before non-leguminous ones
-   Eco farming - maintenance of soil the way nature would do if left alone, feed the soil not the plant
-   Biodynamic farming - biologically organic and ecologically sound and sustainable farming
-   Organic farming - organic manures, non- chemical weed control, biological pest and disease control, mixed farming, crop rotation, organic cycle optimisation
-   Permaculture - design system for sustainable environment ex houses, technology etc
-   Integrated farming - cropping system, animal husbandry, fisheries etc together
-   Macronutrients required by plants are - N,P,K, S, Ca, Mg
    -   Nitrogen - constituent of protein, chlorophyll.
    -   Phosphorous - enzyme to fix light energy, K for carbon assimilation and transportation of photosynthates, water regulation,
    -   Sulphur - part of amino acid builds protein
    -   Ca - cell division, growth and enlargement, pollen growth
-   Some Micronutrients are - Fe, Zn, Vanadium Va, Ni, Si
-   Manures - enriches nutrients, aeration of soil, inc water holding capacity
    -   Farm Yard Manure - cattle dung and urine, litter, fodder etc
    -   Compost manure - well rotted organic matter
    -   Oil cakes mostly rich in N, edible one for cattle and non-edible
    -   Bone Meal - bones of animals rich in K
    -   Fish meal - NPK
    -   Green Manuring - ploughing the green plants to soil, Green Leaf Manuring
    -   Bio- fertilizers - inc micro organisms
-   Nitrogen Fixers -

-   Watershed Mgt - area of land and water bounded by drainage divide within which surface run off collects and flows through an outlet to a river
-   Terracing - reduces the length of hill slide or slope to reduce erosion and formation of gullies
-   Physical characteristics of the location where the soil is formed is called Topography
-   Components of Soil - clay, gravel, Loam(equal mixture of clay, sand, silt and humus), Sand, silt
-   Soil profile - vertical section of soil showing various layers(aka horizons)
-   Sodic soils have more Sodium, pH  8.5
    -   Acidic soils ph  6.0, H+ and Al3+ predominant
    -   pH  8.5 is called alkaline soil, regions with  25 inc rainfall
    -   Alfisol - in forest or savanna vegetation.
    -   Aridisol - found in desert
-   Podzolisation - caused due to excessive leaching of Calcium, are acidic
-   Laterisation - when dried become very hard, process removes silica
-   Gleization - sticky clay formation below the sub surface layer aka hydroorphic soils
-   Solonisation or Alkalisation is the accumulation of Sodium ions
-   Stages of Soil erosion
    -   Splash erosion - 1st stage, when raindrops hit bare soils
    -   Sheet erosion - uniform movement of thin layer of soil
    -   Rill erosion - sheet flows begin to concentrate on land surface, leaving a scouring on the surface
    -   Gully erosion - it is a scoured area not crossable with tillage or grading equipment
-   Allelopathy - harmful effect of one plant over crops
-   Heaving - injury to plants caused by lifting upwards of plant along with soil
-   Contour farming - ploughing across a slope following its elevation contour lines
-   Cover crops - grown to cover crops to reduce loss of moisture from soil due to leaching
-   Hard pan - impermeable layer formed by accumulation of materials, clay etc
-   Sciophytes - shade loving plants, Heliophytes are sun loving
-   Hidden Hunger - plants do not exhibit visual symptoms of deficiency
-   Puddling - ploughing carried out in stagnated water conditions
-   Subsidiary farming - settled farming in river banks
-   System of Rice Intensification SRI - involves changes in nursery mgt, time of transplanting, water and weed management. Synthesis of locally advantageous rice production
