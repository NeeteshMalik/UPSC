- Colonialism controls social, economic, political and cultural life of natives but Im. is more aggressive. For Im. militarism is a must. But for the victims its one and the same.

1.  **Other Reasons** :
	-  Evangelicalism was patronised by Rulers since it was seen as an extension of their power. Missionaries also direcly promoted imperialism Ex David Livingstone in Congo and Zambezi who surveyed the land and reported it to back. Cardinal Levigerie estd Religious influence in France -> helped it occupy Tunisia.
