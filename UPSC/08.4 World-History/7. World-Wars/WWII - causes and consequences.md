##   Hitlers Foreign Policy
###   Make GER great power
-   Destroy Versailles, build army, recover lost terri, bring all German speaking people together, Lebensraum upto Urals, hatred for Jewish Bolshevism,
-   Taylor - never had detailed plan for Lebensraum, never intended major war, only limited war, succeeded coz others did not know what to do
-   Martin Broszat - Lebensraum was mere propaganda exercise
-   Mark Mazower - little evidence Hitler had given serious thoughts of creating a Nazi empire
###   Series of Success

##   Appeasement
-   By BR later FR 2 phases
	-   1920s -1937 avoid war at all cost
	-   1937 - Chamberlain negotiations rather than by force
-   Not defend GER takeover of Polish corridor, FR BR presented Sudetenland - destruction of CZ
###     Justified?

-   Chamberlain believed personal contact b/w leaders to settle disputes
-   Eco coop b/w BR GER good for both

-   Chamberlain actions, in his defence BR needed time to rearm, John Charmley - Ch had little options, Robert Self - had very few alternative credit for trying to prevent war
-   BR FR must share some blame per Richard Overy - their policy governed by national self-interest, moral consideration was secondary, GER also wanted to further econ interest like BR FR
-   USSR for signing non-aggression pact should have allied w/ BR FR

###   Was H to blame
-   Martin Gilbert - motive to remove stigma of defeat 1st WW
-   Trevor- Roper - H intended major war from beginning, hated communism, acquire Lebensraum; evidence in Mein Kampf, Hossbach memorandum
-   Taylor - not intend cause major war, continuing policy of Bismarck, Wilhelm II, Stresemann. GER occupation was result of events in Slovakia not planned, lured into war
-   Neil Gregor - H wanted racial war of destruction radically different from anything from before
-   Tooze - H knew he would eventually confront west powers, when he attacked POL he risked a wider war sooner than later
-   Richard Overy - 25% of industrial workforce on mil orders, shortage of raw materials,
