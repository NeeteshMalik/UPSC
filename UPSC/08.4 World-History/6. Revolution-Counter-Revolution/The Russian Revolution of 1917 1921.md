![[Russian Revolution NCERT IX.pdf]]

##   After 1905

###        **Nicholas II** tries to stabilise his regime because
-   Opponents not united, no central leadership, army loyal to him, Promised concession/October Manifesto
-   **October Manifesto** not addressed industrial working conditions and pay, cancellation of redemption payments/ tax on freedom, amnesty for political prisoners
-   **1st Duma not democratically elected** dispersed in 10 weeks, 2nd Duma - same fate Nicholas denied voting rights to peasants + urban voters, 3rd Duma - no power Tsar controlled ministers secret police

###        Strengths of regime
-   **Stolypin PM** repressive, made efforts to win over peasants, redemption payment abolished, emerged well off peasants Kulaks
-   Signs of imp of Working conditions, industrial profit inc
-   1908 universal education
-   Revolutionary parties lost heart, short of money, disagreements, leaders in exile

###        Weakness
-   Failure of land reforms - peasants growing rapidly, farming methods inefficient to keep up, assassination of Stolypin
-   Industrial Unrest - strikes triggered by shooting of 270 Gold miners
-   Govt repression - esp against students, deported Jews - alienation of peasants, IW, intelligentsia
-   Revival of Rev parties - Bolsheviks, Mensheviks
	-   Bol wanted small disciplined party, must work w/ peasants
	-   Mensheviks - open mem to anybody until fully industrialised, little faith in peasants, strict Marxists
	-   Social Revolutionaries - wanted mainly agrarian society
-   Scandals hit royal family - murder of Stolypin, asso w/ Rasputin
-   Verdict - shootings barricades demonstration in 1914
	-   > Kennan + Haimson - Tsarist regime would have collapsed sooner or later
	-   > Fitzpatrick - regime was vulnerable hard to imagine it could have survived for so long
	-   > Read - overthrow was not inevitable,
	-   > Service - condition of General brittleness, not doomed to suffer revolution of 1917
-   War failures made revo certain
	-   Stone - Nicholas made himself supreme commander was tactical blunder

##   2 Revolution
###   February/March Rev
-   Bread riots in Petrograd, orders to shoot some soldiers refused, Mobs seized buildings released prisoners, Duma advised N to set consti Monarchy he refused, later abdicated throne but Grand Duke Michael refused to accept, Monarchy ended
-   Rev from above/ below organised or spontaneous -
	-   > Katkov - conspiracy among elites was decisive factor
	-   > Chamberlin - leaderless, spontaneous, anonymous rev of all time
	-   > Read, Koenker, Smith - workers motivated by economic considerations rather than politics

####   Provisional Govt
-   Liberal provisional govt set up under Lvov later replaced by Alexander Karensky moderate socialist
#####   Why provisional govt fall from power?
-   Unpopular opinion to continue war Karensky's idea disastrous failure
-   Govt shared power w/ Petrograd soviet(elected committee of soldiers)
-   Govt lost support coz it delayed elections- promise for Constituent assembly, Land reforms not kept
-   Lenin returned from exile - urged that Bol should cease to support provisional govt
-   Economic Chaos - inflation, rising prices, low wages, raw materials fuel shortage, Lenin promised to pull RUS out of war
-   Govt lost popularity due to July days - repression against Bol, Petrograd soviets wanted to take power but members refused
	-   > Richard Pipes - Lenin planned whole affair from begin
	-   > Service - Lenin was improvising 'testing the waters'
-   **Kornilov affair** - Gen Kornilov ordered troops to move against Lenin, mutiny, Karensky sacked Kornilov, Bol popularity inc, by October Bol had gained majority over Mensheviks

### October Revolution 

-   Mid October Lenin ordered Petrograd soviets to seize power supported by Stalin, Sverdlov, Trotsky made most plans, Karensky escaped, almost a bloodless coup

####   Coup or Mass insurrection?
-   Soviet official interpretation → result of mass movt
-   Traditional Liberal interpretation → Bol were professional revolutionaries used chaos in RS to take power.
	-   > Adam Ulam : any determined men could have done what Bol did
	-   > Pipes : due to Lenins desire for power
-   Libertarian : result of popular uprising not aligned w/ Bol who hijacked the movt
	-   > Berkman : Shop and factory committees were pioneers
-   Revisionist : great political awareness among people, masses in favour of govt by soviets

##   Effects 1917 - 24
###   Lack of Majority Support
-   Nationalised all lands, crown estates; workers authority over managers; self determination to all national groups; nationalisation of Banks
-   Bol lost election Social Revolutionaries won most seats, Red Guards dispersed the Constituent assembly, CA must take subordinate position to Congress of Soviets
###   War w/ GER
-   Treaty of Brest Litovsk RUS lost POL, EST, LAT, LIT, UKR, GEO, FIN most farming lands, industries etc.
###   Drift towards violence
-   Soviet, Marxist historians played down violence blames SR
	> -   Hill - no suppression of press, no violence against opponents, death sentence was abolished
-   Jan 1918 food shortage in Petrograd, Moscow
-   UKR lost was imp for wheat production
-   SR undertook assassinations, attempt at Lenin's life
-   Lenin retaliated w/ violence which was flawed
-   Liberal historians reject this interpretation - Lenin, Trotsky committed to use of violence
	> -   Pipes : Lenin regarded terror as absolutely vital

###   Red Terror
-   Cheka/ Secret police executed peasants suspected of hoarding, speculating
-   SRs were shot, many were not guilty, merely accused of being bourgeois
-   Murder of Tsar Nicholas and his family fear of White army using them against Bol

###   Civil War
-   SR, Mensheviks, ex-Tsarists, Peasants etc were opponents, Govt turned into dictatorship from centre instead of local contro
-   Kolchak set up White Govt, Czech Legion PoWs captured trans-siberian railway
-   RUS allies in WW1 helped Whites, Kolchaks march towards Moscow defeated later executed
-   Whites lost - not centrally org, Red army had more troops, War communism to control economic resources of state, Bol presented themselves as nationalists fighting against foreigners

####   Effects of Civil War
-   Enormous cost of human lives, 8 mil total death
-   Changes in communist regime became more centralised, brutal reasons for this
	> -   Tucker - civil war was responsible,
	> -   Read - Bol were products of tsarist env,
###   Lenin and economic problems -
-   War communism unpopular w/ peasants
-   Naval Mutiny in Kronstadt - New Economic Policy NEP - allowed Peasants to keep surplus in lieu of tax, foreign investment to modernise Russian industry
-   Econ began to recover considerable achievement
###   Political problems solved decisively
-   Main political problem disagreement and criticism within Communist Party
-   Lenin banned factionalism, expelling if views not in line
-   Governing body known as Politburo

###   Lenin

```ad-Views

**Taylor** : Lenin did more than any other political figure to change face of 20th century world

**Lewin** : forced unwillingly into policies and in last years struggling to steer communist into a more peaceful phase

**Liberal View** : ruthless dictator; Potresov - Evil genius, hypnotic effect on people

**Service** : Lenin was certainly ruthless, intolerant repressive despite of this he was visionary
